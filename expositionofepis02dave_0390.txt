380 Α nissssnrArmN οΝ Tur: DEATn or CHRIST.

Christ on the cross, is of wider extent, and is as far appli-
cable as it is announceable, and will bring salvation to
every one provided he believes it. At the same time we
leave to God his own secret will, according to which he
hath mercifully determined to work effectually in some that
they may believe, and to leave others to their inherent ob-
duracy, and not to work effectually in them that they may
believe. Ι add further, That there was in Christ himselsa
will according to which he willed that his death should re-
gard all 111611 individually3 and there was also awill ac-
cording to which he willed that it should pertain to the
elect alone. He willed that it should regard all the poste-
rity of Adam who should be saved, and that it should ac.-
tually save them all, provided they should embrace it with
atrue faith. He willed that it should so pertain to the
elect alone, that by the merit of it all things which relate
to the obtaining of salvation, should be infallibly given to
them. And in this sense we confess that the oblation of
Christ is of the same extent as the predestination of God.
Of which more will be said hei-eafter.

OssJssc‘rioN 8. If the death of Christ is determined to
be applicable to each and every man according to the or-
dination of God, then all discrimination between the elect
and non-elect is removed, and the doctrine of predestina-
tion is altogether overturned ε For if Christ may be said in
any sense whatever to have died for all, what hinders us
from declaring in the same sense that all men individually
are elected by God ‘3

REPLY 8. These objections proceed from ignorance of
the true reason of election or predestination. For it is not
any kind of ordination to salvation, through whatever
means, which places man in the number of the elect or
predestinated, but an ordination through such means as God
both knew and decreed would infallibly produce the effect
of salvation in the elect person. Hence is that definition
of predestination by Augustine (on Perseverance, cap. 14)
