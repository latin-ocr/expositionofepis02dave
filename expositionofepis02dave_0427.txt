Chap. iv. THE secono PROPOSITioN s'rATED, ac. 417

to be altogether denied as to Christ having died sufficiently
for all; or to be joined with an ordination of his death
pertaining to all. Secondly, what they say, that this
phrase, Christ diedfor alt susficiently, has a foundation in
the thing itself, cannot be defended from their opinion. If
I should say, the death of Christ is a sufficient ransom for
all, there is a true foundation for this saying in the thing
itself, namely‚ in the dignity of the person dying; but if
1 should say, Christ died or was offered on the cross
(which are equivalent) for all sufficiently‚ there is now no
foundation on which the truth of this saying can stand,
unless I assert first, that Christ suffered and was offered
for all, and then add the sufficiency of this suffering for
all, on account of the dignity of the ransom. He who
denies one of these, in vain attempts to defend the other. ,
We therefore conclude, that neither can Christ be truly said
to have suffered or died for all sufficiently, nor can the death
of Christ be truly acknowledged to be an universal remedy
applicable to all men according to the ordination of God,
unless in addition to the mere sufficiency of the thing de-
rived from its innate dignity, we admit the settled and fixed
decree of God, according to which, from the will of God
in accepting this sacrifice, and of Christ in offering it,
this death of Christ is able to bring eternal life to each and
every man. Hitherto we have treated of the first part of
our proposition, in which we have shewn, that that mere
sufficiency‚ which is understood of the death of Christ
considered in itself, is not enough for the conclusion, that
Christ should be said to have died for all, or that his
death should be accounted an universal cause of salvation
in regard to the whole human race. Let us now shew what
that is which is further requisite for this purpose. For the
illustration of this subject, the second thesis may serve:
Second. The death (ff Christ, according to the evan-
gelical covenan't corfirmed by it with all men, is affirmed
to· lzave been truly endnreclfor all men, and Christ, in tlte same
respect, is asserted to haue died szgfjicient& for all men. We
allude to that covenant of which we have before made
mention, If thou slmlc believe, thou slmlt be saved ; or leo-
