432 A DISSERTATION ΟΝ THE DEATH OF CHRIST.

sure 2⁶21 the death of the wiclced, but tlzat the wiclced turn from
lzz's way and live. (Ezek. xxxiii. 11). Therefore‚ not only
according to the absolute power of God, but according to
his ordinary power, any unbelieving and impenitent person
whatsoever may be endued with true repentance and saving
saith. Of the unbelieving Jews, the Apostle truly says,
(Rom. xi. 23), God z's able to graft them in again. And of
all obstinate sinners it is rightly declared in the name of
God (Rev. ii. 21), [gave tlzem space to repent, and they re-
pented not. He has so granted to mankind the whole
space of this life, that in any moment of it conversion to
God may bring salvation to them, according to the cele-
brated saying of the prophet Ezekiel (xviii. 21, 22), If the
wiclced will turn from all lzis sins that he Izatlz committed, Sec.
all his transgressions, &a shall not be mentioned nuto lzz‘m.

the damned in hell, the grace of saith and repentance.
Hence it is that wc ought not to determine any one to be

God suffers to live.

body, to every living person. For although the natural

joined and united to it, yet this mystical head can act to-
wards members separated from it, and communicate to
them quickening grace, by means of which they may be-
come united to it. In which sense Aquinas hath not badly
stated, (Part. 3, qu. 9, art. 3,) 'Ilzat Christ is the head os all
men, but in dfferent degrees. He is principally said to be.
the head of those who are united to him by an actual com-
munication of his glory. But in aless degree he is the
head of those who, according to the ordinary law of God,
may yet be united to him, whether that power be brought
into action or not. But of those who have no capability
of receiving the influence of Christ, he can in no way be
called the head. The damned, and those alone, ought to
be considered in this state ; because, according to the pro-
