‘¹ DAvm PAREus, or Plana, was born of Protestant parents ofa respect-
able rank, at Frankenstein, in Silesia, in 1548, and in due time put to a
Grammar school there. His father, whose name as a German was VVang-
ler, (an appellation which the son afterwards, in conformity with literary·
pride, commuted into a word of the same signification derived from the
Greek) becoming a widower, contracted a second marriage, the consequence
of which was, that his design of making his son a scholar was frustrated,
and he was disposed of otherwise as speedily as possible, by being first
placed with an apothecary and then transferred to ashoemaker. Providence
however had ordained otherwise respecting David, and many years had not
elapsed, when, from the strong bent of his son's genius towards literary
pursuits, his father resumed his first design; and at about sixteen years of
age he was sent to the College school of Hermsberg, and being so fortunate
as to come under the instructions of Christopher schilling‚ his progress in
learning was equally sound and rapid. Being obliged to quit Hermsberg,
owing to religious troubles, he removed in 1566, first to Amberg, and
shortly after to Heidelberg, which University was then in a most flourish-
ing condition. Here he seems to have remained till 1571, when he was
appointed Cure of the village of Schlettenbach3 but being shortly after
recalled to Heidelberg, after other changes and reverses, he finally settled
there in 15843 he obtained different Professorships in the University, and
entered warmly into the controversies carrying on between the Lutherans
and the Calvinists, and printed his “ Method of the Ubiquitarian Contro-
versy.’' He acquired the esteem of the Elector Palatine and other persons
of high rank and consideration, and in 1589 printed, under their auspices,
an Edition of the Scriptures in German with Notes. In 1592 he was elected
an Ecclesiastical Counsellor‚ and the year following took his Doctor's De-
gree with great eclat. In 1617 there was kept an Evangelical Jubilee, in
commemoration of the Church's deliverance from Popery an hundred years
before. The solemnities were held three days, during which there were
continual orations, disputations, poenis, and sermons suited to the occasion-
Pareus published some pieces on the subject, which drew upon him the re-
sentment of the Jesnits of Mentz, who wrote a sharp censure upon him,
