one eternal and most unchangeable will of God.

OBJECTION 2. God is actually reconciled to him whom
he actually loves, But he loves all the elect from eternity3
Therefore he is actually reconciled to them from eternity :
Therefore they are also actually reconciled and justified
from eternity.

Rsspm. A distinction is to be made with Aquinas, that
God is said to love in a twofold manner3 according to his
purpose qf communicating his goodness‚ and according to the
act (ff communication. (In 3, Sent. dist. 19.) The love ac-
cording to his eternal purpose, which Divines call The love
(ff eterna] benevolence, does not make him who is loved in
this manner to be esteemed by God as actually justified or

among those who are infallibly to be justified and recon-
ciled. There is, therefore, a different kind of words which
denote acts inherent in God and acts which flow from God
to us. The former, such as· love, election, predestinatz’on, are

men are called beloved, elect, pmdestfflated, on account of
the secret good pleasure of the Divine will conceived and -
hidden in himself. The latter, such as calling, ‚justfficatz'om
reconciliation, glorification, are external acts, which termi-

received by him3 and from these no one is properly said to
be called, justffied, reconciled, glorg‘fied, solely from the se-
cret and eternal purpose of the Divine will, but from the
covenanted performance of the same. purpose, and from
the effect being produced in men. We confess, therefore,
the eternal will in God ofjustifying and reconciling to
himself all the elect3 but we deny that they ought to be
said to have been justified or reconciled from eternity: In
the same manner as we acknowledge that there was in God
an eternal will of creating the world, and yet we deny that
the world was created from eternity. What Zanchius says
of the actual remission of sins, we say of the actual re·
conciliation of the elect, (Thomson. Diatr. p. 96) It is in-
