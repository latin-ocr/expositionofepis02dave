gust than psalms or hymns (which the Hebrews call schi-
rz'm). The Apostle would have us to entertain and promote
our hilarity by these, according to that direction of St·
James, av. 13, If any be merry, lec him sing psalms. But in
these psalms and hymns, or songs of beneven-s, four condi-
tions are required :—

1. That they must be spiritual] and thatin a twofold re-
spect3 as well in regard to the origin, as in regard to the
matter. As to the origin: like as Moses, David, and others,
under the impulse of the Holy Spirit, composed and sang
their hymns, psalms. and songs3 so we, whether we sing
the same or others, ought to do it by the influence and di-
lection of the Holy Spirit. That the psalms and hymns of
the godly flow as it were from the primary author, is ga-
thered from Ephes.v.18, 19, Be not drunk zoztlz wine, says
the Apostle, bat befilled witlz tlte spirit.- Spealcing to your-
selves in psalms, and hymus, and spiritual songs, 810. ,Α8
though he had said, As wine is wont to excite the drunk-
ards to foolish‚ silly, and lascivious airs; so does the Spi-
ritinspire the godly to psalms‚ and hymus, and spiritual
songs. We have examples in the Ne'w Testament, of the
blessed Virgin, Zacharias, and Simeon: and also in the
primitive Church, certain of the holy fathers composed
hymns, remains of which we retain even to this day. These
psalms, hymns, and songs are also spiritual as to the mat-
ter: For they treat of spiritual things, relating to the glory
of God and our salvati0n3 not of secular, vain, and carthly
matters. This is the first condition.

2. They must be sung with grace] Some explain grace
in this passage to mean gratit11de‚ or tl'zauksgiring‚ The
word grace is sometimes taken in this sense. In 1 Cor. xv.
57, But chana-S, χαρίς, beto God, who givetlz ns tlte victory;
and in 2 Cor. ii. 14, But tlziznlcs, καρίς, beto God, who always
causetlz us to triumph in Christ. Gratitude is not improperly
joined to songs; because we are for the most part moved
to sing in joyous and prosperous circumstances, in which
condition the affection of gratitude is binding and plainly
necessary. But others explain these words witl'zgrace, willa
