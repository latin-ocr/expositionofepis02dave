Ver. 13. EPISTLE To THE conossmNs. 111

brates in Prov. xvi. 32, He that is slow to anger is better
than the mighly; and he tlzat ruletlz his spirit than lze that
taketh α city. To conquer oneser z's tlte greatest (gf conquests,
says Plato.

2. He who forbears, conquers the very malice of his
enemy. For when two contraries are in contention and
conflict, that is said to conquer which draws the other
into similarity with itself3 that to be conquered, which is
drawn or changed by the other. Therefore‚ like as we say
water is overcome by fire, when it becomes warm3 and, on
the contrary, to have overcome it, if, retaining its own
cold, it can subdue the fire: so we say a Christian is over-

that from breathing blood and slaughter, he melts into tears
and entreaties, confesses his fault, and is compelled to
acknowledge and extol David’s innocence and meekness.
Who does not here see the malice of Saul overcome, and
the patience os David triumphing?

by lawful means, and those which God commands his sol-
diers to use. Now it behoves a soldier obeying the corn-
mand of his general, not only to sight, but to do it with
those arms, and in that manner which is assigned him.

ii. 5. But hear the deeree of our commander, Prov. xxiv.
29, Say noc I will do so to him as lie llatlz done to me ; Iwill
render to clze man according ,to ln's work. Recompence lo 710
man evilfor evil, Rom. xii. 17 ; and again, vers· 21, Be not
overcome of evil, buc overcome evil wz'tlz good. So much for
the act of forbearing.

Audforgz'vz'ng one another] In this second act there is
more contained than in the former. For there are some
