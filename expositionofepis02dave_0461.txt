teaches that until that time they had remained strangers
from the covenants of promise, and were alienated from
God, until by faith, as a spiritual hand, they appropriated
to themselves the riches of Divine grace treasured up in
Christ3 as it may readily be collected from ver. 7 and 8 of
this Chap. ii. Of the same meaning are those words of
the same Apostle, (Rom. v. l) Being justified by saith, we
have peace witlz God, through οιιν Lot-d Jeszcs Christ. There-
fore the death of Christ, considered in itself, until saith is
added on our part, does not place any individual in a state
of grace. Finally, the Apostle Paul was, without doubt,
one of the elect, yet he was not on that account either
justified, or brought into a state of grace and salvation,
whilst he remained a blasphemer against Christ and a per· Ι
secutor of the Church, but after he had known Christ and
cast himself altogether upon Christ. (l Tim. i. 16,) For
tlzz's cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might
shew fortlz all long-sefflring, for α pattern to them· which
should herecffter believe on him to lise everlastz'ng. Therefore
remission of sins through the blood of Christ does not
precede faith and repentance‚ not even in the elect.

Hitherto we have contended with express testimonias of
the Scriptures, now let us add some arguments founded on-
the same Scripturas.

ARGUMENT 1. Although we grant that the death of
Christ, as a meritoriows cause, is most sufficient to expiate
the sins of all men, and place them in a state of grace
with God, yet, it cannot actually constitute any man justi-
fied and reconciled, unless it be in some wayjoined, fitted,
and united to him who is supposed to be justified and re-
conciled by it. For what philosophers are accustomed to
say, Every action z's performed-by some contact, avails also in
this supernatural action, which is not performed without
some supernatural contact. Now we touch Christ by faith
and we are joined and as it were united to him by the Spi-
rit of saith. For Christ clwelseth in us hyfaitlz. Without
saith, then, or before faith, we have no actual union with
Christ, and therefore no remission of sins through the me-
