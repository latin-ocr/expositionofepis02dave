192 AN EXPOSlTION or ετ. PAUL’S Chap. iii.

4. Children are provoked, when parentS, out of wan-
tonness and fury, beat and chastise them with unjust or
immoderate stripes and punishments. I call that unjust
chastisement, for which there is not a legitimate cause.
Thus Saul even wished to strike his son with ajavelin, for
no other reason than that he had taken upon himself the
defence of David, who was absent and innocent, l Sam.
xx. 33, Wheresore Jonatlzan arose from the table infierce αη-

duty, says Cicero.

3. Although it is not lawful to provoke and exasperate

ed from Ephes. vi. 4, Fathers, provoke not *your children to
wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition (ff
the Lorsl. For instruction and chastisement of offending
children falls under the Divine command, and it makes for
