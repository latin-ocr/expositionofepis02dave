74 AN EXPOS¹T10N or sT. PAUL's Chapdii.

as bad fruit betrays a bad tree, so ridiculous and obscene
words, a ridiculous and obscene mind. For as Clemens
adds (ibid) α mcm's discourse is thefruit os his mind.

3. Because it is opposed to the sacred profession of a
Christian. Hence says the Apostle, Ephes. v. 3, 4, But
fornication and all uncleanness or covecousness, let z't not be
once named among you as becometh saints. An evil word,
says Lactantius, proceeds not from the⁴ mouth of him who
cultivates chaste language. This has reference to all Chris-
tians, but especially to those who are ministers of the
word. T hou hast consecrated thy mouth to the Gospel : it is
unlawful to open z‘tsor Such things ; sacrilege to accustom it to
them, says Bernard. Whence that Canon of the Council
of Carthage cited by Gratiam which runs, We are of opin—
ion that α minister who plays the bnffoon and foul-mouthed
jesler should he stript <ff his <ffice- For soolish sayz'ngs in the

what belongs to the hearers; we have Chrysostom's just
remark, As (lust and mud malfe the ears ‘ff the flesh uncIeun,
30 cloes obscene and filthy communication the hearing osche
mind. We shall conclude with that saying of our Saviour,
Matt. xii. 36, But Isay unto you, that sor every idle word
men shall speak, they shall give an account therecff at the day
ffjzedgment. If, then, an idle word will receive the con-
demnation of a rigorous judge, how much more a foul or
injurious one? leinlc then how worlhy ‘ff condenmatz'on he
is, who does not refroin from mallee, when those words are
punishable which merely are wanting in utilz'ty. Thus reasons
Gregory, Dial. lib. 3. Let ηε, then, put away from our
mouths all malice and evil speaking, or filthy communica-
tion‚ as what defiles us with its foulness.

We may add to what hath been said,
