Chap. vii. As ιτ REGARDS THE PREDESTlNATED. 5733

himself in conformity to the will of the Father, is under-
stood to have been destined and applied to the elect, whom
God hath determined infallibly to save by his death, in a
different way from its application to others, whom God
permits, notwithstanding this death, to perish through
their own fault. Whoever denies that the death of Christ
was offered for men, and that it is applied to thern with
this difference, may by the same means deny that God,
who is most wise and most powerful, either knows not how
or cannot design and accommodate differently to various
persons the means which were instituted by himself, as the
different manner of his will demands.

ARGUMENT 8. It is certain from the event that some
men apply to themselves the death of Christ, with its infir
nite merit, really and effectually for salvation. Ι ask, then,
whether this application is made according to the antece-
dent and effectual intention of Christ in offer-ing himself
on the cross, or contrary to it, or without any such pre-
ceding intention? If it should be granted, that Christ in
dying had an antecedent and special will concerning the
effectual application‚ which pertains to all the elect, and
to them alone, this is the very thing we are endeavouring
to prove, namely‚ that this death was destined, according ·
to the special intention of God and Christ, to be effec-
tually applied to the elect. But no man would sav, that
any person can effectually apply this death to himself con-
trary to the intention of Christ. There is but one thing
remaining, viz. We say that this effectual application is
made by some men according to the freedom of their own
will, without any special, preceding, absolute. and effec-
tual intention of the will of God. But religion forbids us
to assert this: Firsc, because in good and saving actions
the effectual will of God is antecedent to the effectual will
of man, For z't z's God which worketlz in us hotlz to will and to
do <gf leis good pleasure, (Philip. ii. 13) and he doth not work
any thing in us antecedently which he hath not antece·
dently determined to work. Seconclly, because in those
works which pertain to salvation we can do nothing with-
out Christ, (John xv. 5,) Wiclzout me με. can do nothing.
