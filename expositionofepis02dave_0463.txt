of God has infinite and eternal efficacy, this inconvenience
also would follow, That the sins of men were pardoned
before they were committed, were expiated before they
were perpetrated, if the remissiori of sins and actual re-
conciliation of men arose solely from the merit of Christ,
without any intermediate act of ours [by which the benefit
is conveyed to us} But this is plainly impossible. For
as a medicine, which as to its own efficacy and virtue may
cure the leprosy, yet does not actually heal any man, but
a leper who takes it; so the blood of Christ, which can
heal any man, yet does not actually heal, or cleanse, or
reconcile any man to God, but him who is contaminated
with sin and believes. Therefore, they are by no means to
be attended to who pretend that all men promi-scuously are

reconciled and placed in a state of grace by the passion of'
Christ itself‚ or who contend that all the elect, by the vir-
tue alone of the same passion, have all their sins pardoned
froin eternity, since there is no pardon of sins but of those
which are committed, nor any pardon of sins committed to
be hoped for by any but by those who believe. Excellently

Calcedon, on the subject of the Sacrament. In 1597, he proceeded Db,
and soon after the accession of James Ι. that monarch appointed him one of
his Chaplains in ordinary, and conceived so high an opinion of his writings,
that he ordered his own Commentary upon part of the Apocalypse to be
printed in 1608 with the second Edition of Abbot's book De Antichristo. In,
1609, 116 was chosen Master of Baliol College, Oxford, at which he had
matriculated, and which rose into distinction by his exertions. In 1610, 116
was nominated by the King one of the first fellows of the Royal College at
Chelsea, then newly founded for the encouragement of Polemical Divinity ;
