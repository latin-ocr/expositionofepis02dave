78 AN EXPOSlTloN OF ετ. 1»Αυι,’5 Cleap. iii.

who are of this opinion have not God, but Plato, for ‘the
author of such licentiousness : for he, in 3, De repub. says,
Falselzood z's sometimes useful to men, as a medicine is : where-
fore it z's to be allowed to the public Plzysz‘cians ,· but to be mecl-
dled with as little as possible by private people. So much for
Plat03 who is, however, less indulgent to this sin of lying
than Cassian. Jerome fastens this error upon Origen, lib.
1, Apolog. adv. Ruffin, where he writes, tlze dz'scz'ples of
Origen are united among themselves by tlte* insane myster-ies <ff
lies ,· Orzgem'scas inter se orgiis mendaciorum faciet-ara* But
to all these errors we oppose those things which we have
already adduoed, and especially that admonition of the
Apossse, Rom. iii. 8, that we are not to do evil that good may

come.

3. Let us inquire whether parabolic and figurative ex-
pressions deserve the name of lying. For example, sup-
pose one to say that a Heretio is a. wolf; or should any
one recite a parable, as that in Judges ix. 8, of the trees
choosing tp themselves a king, and many other such which

occur in the Scriptures.

ed as they were by many subsequent heads of 0rders, one cannot wonder
at that Jesuitry—-that sophistry and guile, which has since distinguished the
Roman church, and is now clothing Romanism in a garb to suit modern
sentiments and modern liberality.

’⁵ This great man, Origen, following as he did the principles of the Pla-
tonic philosophy, and imagining that the nature and extent of the reason of
all doctrines of Religion might be found in it, and engaging a number of
disciples‚ may be stated to have been the head of such speculative notioris,
and the mysticism they gave rise to. For from his disciples emanated in
time the Philosophic or Scholastic theology, remarkable mostly for such ab-
surdities. Vide Mosheim, under the notices of Origen.—As to what was
just before remarked‚ as alleged in favour of the monstrosity so insidiously
maintained, Cecilhas well observed, that “ the instances of artifice which
“ occur in Scripture are not to be imitated, but avoided: if Abraham, or
“ Isaac, or Jacob equivocate in order to obtain their ends, this is no war·
“ rant to me to do so: David's falsehood concerning Goliath's sword argued
“ distrust of God. 1f any part of the truth which Ι 3111 bound to commu-
“ nic-ate be concealed‚ this is sinful artifice: the Jesuits in China, in order
“ to remove the offence of the Cross, declared that it was a falsehood in-
“ vented by the Jews that Christ was crucified3 but they were expelled
‘⁴ from the empire: and this was designed, perhaps, to be held up as a
‘⁶ warning to all Missionaries, that no good end is to becarried by artificef*
