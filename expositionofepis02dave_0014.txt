4 AN EXPOSlTloN or ετ. PAUL's Chap. iii.

new and heavenly life must be entered upon by those who
are risen again with Christ. 2, The indwelling corruption
of our nature must be mortified by those who are dead with

Christ.

It remains that we prooeed to the parts of this Chapter.
And here we have a two-sold exhortation: A Genera! one
which regards all Christians alike, from the beginning of
the Chapter to verse 18. A special, or personal one, which
is directed to certain orders of Christians, namely, to
wives and husbands, children and parents, servants and
masters3 from the 18th verse to the end of the Chapter.
The general exhortationis distributed into three branches.

The first, comprehended in the four first verses, teaches

= us how, and stirs us up to seek the true end, that is to say,
heaven, and Christ dwelling in heaven.

The second exhorts to the practice of those things
which are ordained to this end. And this practice con-
sists in mortification, i. e. the laying aside of vices; and
vivification‚ i. e. the exercise of all virtues: concerning
which he discourses largely from the 5th to the loth
verse.

The third calls to the meditation and study of the Divine
Word, and likewise prescribes a general rule to be observed
in all our actions, vers. 16 and 17.

Ι conceived these things should be premised‚ because we
are led more easily by parts to the knowledge of the whole.
Ι shall not follow out more of this sort, because (as Seneca
has well observed) there is in too many divisions as great a
fault as in 710 division. It is useful to distribute a subject
matter into parts3 it is frivolous to minoe it: for to take
in the minutest points with the same care as one would the
greatest, is mere toil. Therefore, we shall observe the
parts and smaller matters of the divisions as they offer
themselves in the explanation of the context, which, rely-
ing upon the Divine aid and the illumination of the Holy
Spirit, we forthwith enter upon.
