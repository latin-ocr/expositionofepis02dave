452 A nissERTATioN oN THE DEATH or· cumsr.

rit of his death, no justification, no reconciliation with
God the Father. The learned Calvin has observed this on
Rom. viii. 4, Clzrz'st communientes his riglzleozesness to none but
those whom lzis sz‘rit writes by a hond to himself. Whatever‚
therefore, is concealed in the eternal decree of God con-
cerning justifying and reconciling to himself, and at length
saving all the elect, whatever of sufficiency or efficacy
there may be in the precious blood of Christ to redeem
men and reconcile them to God, yet it is'not wont to proceed
into the effect of actual reconciliation, unless he is first
joined to men by faith, because both the meritorious and
the natural cause ought to be joined to that into which it
flows and transfuses its saving virtue.

⁴ ARGUMENT 2. Itis proved, secondly, from a compa-
rison between Adam, the author of death and condemna-
tion, and Christ, the Author oflife and justification. For
as Adam does not bind any under the penalty of death, nor
subject any to Divine wrath and condemnation, but those
who become his members, as it were, by generati0n3 so
Christ does not deliver any from death, nor restore any to
Divine favour, orjustify and reconcile them to God, but
those who become his members by supernatural regenera-
tion. But this does not take place before faith is inspired
into our hearts. John i. 12, 13, As many as received him, to
them gave lle power lo become the sous of God, even rothem
that believe on his name, wlziclz were born not (ff blood, &o but
(ff God. Therefore no one, either of those who are passed
by or of the elect, stands reconciled and justified before
God by the death ofChrist itself; but at the time when he
is incorporated with Christ, and by regeneration is made,
as it were, a member of this mystical head, he obtains the
righteousness of Christ and peace with God.

ARGUMENT 3. If by the merit of the death of Christ
alone all the sins of men were pardoned before they be-
lieve in Christ, and so all were actually restored to a state
of grace and reconciliation, it would follow that no one is
born a child of wrath3 which is diametrically opposite to
the words of the Apostle just now quoted from Ephes. ii.
