should extend to all men, even to the very close of this

life, a power of this kind would indeed he in vain, unless

it should be effectual in some persons; but that it is not

effectual as to all mankind, is to be referred partly to the

secret will of God, partly to the manifest depravity of
men. ln both respects, through the capacity or power of
faith and salvation, which is not effectual as to many,

God obtains a greater manifestation of his mercy towards

the elect, and of hisjustice towards the wicked, unbeliev-

ing, and impenitent of mankind 3 and therefore such pow-

er is not granted to them in vain. Alvareff well says, (De

Auxiliis, disp. 105) [η order that αηι] power may not be in

vain, it is not required tlzat z't should sometimes be exerted in

some action whiclz ic cmz effect, but z't is sufficient that it may

be exerled in some one or more ffthenz. For as no one could 1
truly=say, that power was given in vain to men by nature

to understand Mafflematics, although many who are ca-

pable of learning them, do not actually find masters to=in-

struet them ; so can no man affirm that this power to be-

lieve and repent is granted in vain to all living men by the

fixed law of God, although God does not effectually work

in all men saith and repentance.

2. It is also objected, that it seems to cause
greater doubts in the mind, that God should not only
have foreknown from eternity‚ but have. predestinated to
whom he would infallibly give faith, remission, and eternal
life, and to whom he would not give it. But God cannot do
other things in time, or act otherwise than he foreknew
from eternity and decreed that he would act. Abelard†
