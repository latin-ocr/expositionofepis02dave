398 Α DlSSERTATlON ΟΧ Tur: DEATH OF CHRIST-

believe in Christ shall be saved. This efficacy of the
death of Christ the Gospel proclaims and promises to all
the world3 but that infallible purpose of applying this
death to certain persons, the ministers of the Gospel can-
not promise to any mortal by name. We say, therefore,
that the death of Christ was ordained for all those to whom
remissiori of sins may be announced through saith in his
blood, which grace regards every partaker of human na-
ture. But we confess that the death of Christ is infallibly
to be applied to the elect alone, because the certainty of
the application depends, as to the primax-y cause, on the
secret and eternal act of God in predestinating, and not
only on the act of Christ in offering up himself for men.
Christ, therefore, in offering up himself had a general in-
tention conformed to the ordination of the Father, namely,
that he might deliver any persons whatsoever indiscrimi-
nately from the guilt of their sins, provided they should
believe in him, and in this sense he is said to have offered
up himself for all. He had also, as conscious of the Di-
vine predestination‚ a special intention conformed to the
secret and eternal good pleasure of the Father, namely,
that he might obtain through the merit of his death sorbis
sheep, who were given to him according to the decree of
election, and might give them faith, salvation, and all
things. And with this special intention it is said, that he
laid down his life sor his own peculiar people, that is, for
certain individua] persons. That which comes to certain
persons from the death of Christ,¹ by the special act of Di-
vine predestination, ought not to overthrow that which is
acquired by all through the very act of the oblation. The
infallible application to one person rather than to another
may be ascribed to predestination‚ but that which may be
applicable to every individual through faith‚ may be as-
signed, from the tenor of the Divine covenant, to the ob-
lation of Christ itself.

OBJEchN 17. The last objection is derived from
those passages in which the death of Christ is expressly
referred to certain persons3 from which they infer, that
they have no regard to others. The passages which are
