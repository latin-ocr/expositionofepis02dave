right to eternal life. To this latter step no one comes by
the work of Christ alone, by his having·> offered up himself
on the cross to God the Father3 but it is necessary, before
he obtains this actual reconciliation, to add the act or
work of the man himself believing in Christ the Redeemer,
and applying the merit of his death to himself individu-
ally by faith. To this may be referred John viii. 24, [f ye
believe not that Ι cem lle, με shall die in your sins. Therefore
the death of Christ does not deliver from death, nor ac-
tually reconcile to God any individual person, except he
believe.

Having made this distinction or explanation of the word
νεεοησίίὶαίίοη, let us return to our proposed thesis, the first
member of which, to be confirmed by us in the first place,
is thus expressed : By the act ‘ff the death of Christ, God is
sofar reconciled to every man, tlzat lze is ready to admit any
one z'ntofavour, and moreover, to eternal life, ifhe should only
believe. We shall discuss this matter in the fewer words,
because all that we have said respecting the universal co-
venant confirmed by the death of Christ, on condition of

add some remarks.

first, then, the very tenor of our preaching of the Gos-
pel demonstrates this. For what else do we preach to
wicked men, and those who are as yet unbelieving, but
that it has been brought about by the death of Christ, that
the will of God is far different towards the human race,
than it would have been without this death? In other words,
that just God who, without the blood of the Mediator,
breathed nothing else than wrath and death against us all in-

dividually‚ being now pacified by the blood ofthe Redeemer,
is ready to grant pardon and life to all individually who
humble themselves before him and believe in the Mediator.
God would never have commanded his ministers to preach
this to mankind promiscuously, unless he had been really
so disposed in mind3 since the Gospel is tlze word (ff truth,
(Col. i. 5) because it announces nothing salse or vain to
sinners. But it pronounces and promises that God is so
far pacified by the effic-acy of the blood of Christ shed
