Ver. 19. EPISTLE To THE comessurus. 165.

for light causes he even remits the affection of love, it
must be ascribed to bitterness.

2. This also is plain from the example of Christ, who
is proposed as an example to husbands by the Apostle.
For he is not wont to hate or despise his church for her
many faults and sins3 but he rather studies to amend and
cover her sins, whilst no odium is cast upon her person τ
Such ought to be the affection of the husband towards his
wife. No fault or sin of the wife ought then to extinguish
that matrimonial affection, unless it be of that kind as to
extinguish and dissolve matrimony itself: for the wife re-
mains, whilst matrimony continues, one flesh with her hus-
band z But no one never Izated lzis own flesle, bnt nom-islzetlz

all bitterness is to be banished afar off from the very mind
and affection of the husband.

2. Secondly, this bitterness seems to be placed in

words, than the body is by sharp weapons: Hence words
are sometimes compared by the Psalmist to darts and
swords. Psal. lv. lt does not therefore become the hus-
band to wound his wife by these swords. (Arist. Rhet.)
As to contumelious words, they are most foreign from duty
and from matrimonial love. For the design of contumely
is, that one may rejoice in the disgrace of him who is
treated contumeliously: but it is barbarous to rejoice in
the disgrace of his own wife. But neither is that bitter-
ness of passionate men to be suffered, which breaks out
into hard words, and threats‚ although there may be no
