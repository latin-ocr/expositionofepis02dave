will of applying, as well as the benefit ofthe death applied,
according to the decree of his special meroy.

5. That work which truly and deservedly, as soon as it
is understood to have been agreed upon between God the
Father and the Son, gives to Christ the name of the Re-
deemer of the world and Saviour of the world, is to be ac-
knowledged as an universal cause of salvation, or an uni-
versal remedy, applicable to the whole human race: But
such was the work of the obedience of Christ unto the
death of the cross ; Therefore it is applicable to the whole
human race. The major is confirmed from hence, that on
account of the price pald, Christ would be only a partial
Redeemer and Saviour, if the price paid were not, accord-

the title of Redeemer and Saviour of' tlze world, ought at the
same time to grant, that this redemption from whence he
is so named, was the payment of the price due for the li-

that he cannot require any other satisfaction in order to re·
concile any man to himself3 and it is so far profitable to
us all, that any sinner may be delivered, provided he should
believe in this Redeemer, and (what in respect to reme-
dies ought to be done) should apply to himself this saving
medicine by saith. In this sense we truly say, that Christ
died for all men, and that this death of Christ, or redemp-
tion acquired by his death, is a merit applicable to all men
individually, which cannot in any way be affirmed of the
fallen angels. Christ Jesus iS, therefore, the Redeemer
and Saviour of all men causally, as the Schoolmen say,
that is, by instituting and supplying a sufficient cause, or-
dained and accepted by God, for expiating the sins of all
those who are willing to make use of this remedy. This
is a sufficient foundation for the title of universal Savz'our
und Redeemer, although the will of believing is not given
to all. Now let us go to the minor, which is so plain that
it does not need any laborious proof. The Scriptures, by
viewing this death of Christ as applicable to all, call
