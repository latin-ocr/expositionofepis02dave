132 AN EXPOSlTlON or ετ. raons elmp.iii=.

Hence we derive these instructions :

1. It is the duty of pastors to call and excite the peo-
ple to the constant reading and meditation of the Scrip-
tures: it is the duty of the people to o-bey such exhorta·
tlons.

2. They grievously sin who excite Christian people* to
the knowledge of human traditions and sables3 in the
mean time forbidding them, as a thing full of danger, the
reading of either Testament, that is, of the Divine word.

3. The word of God ought not only to be publiiely
preached in the temples, but to be rea-d and heard in pri-
vate houses.

4. In the word of God is contained the treasure of all
wisdom necessary to salvation.

5. All, even the laios, should labour to obtain an un-
derstanding and full knowledge of Divine things.

6. That implied knowledge* which the Papists would
have to be sufficient for the laity, is the offspring of lazi,-
ness, the mother of impiety, not of devotion.

Therefore, the decree of the Council of Trent, and re-
ceived opinion of the Papists, by which they deny that
the Scriptures ought to be had in the vernacular tongue‚ or
that the study of the Scriptures is to be required from the
laity, may be refuted from this passage : nay, they affirm,
that it is more safe for them to be restrained from reading
the Scriptures, and is sufficient for them to regulate their
course of life by the direction of their Pastors'aloness

The decree of the Council of Trent referred to by our author, is the one
passed at the fourth sessionq on the Rule of Paith 3 from which it is evident
that the unrestrained perusal of the Scriptures is regarded by the Romish
Church as pregnant with danger. The fourth Rule of the ‘⁶ Congregation
of the Index‚” framed upon the Spirit of the Decree, says‚ “ Itis mani-
“ fest from experience, that if the Holy Bible, translated into the vulgar
“ tongue, be indiscriminately allowed to every one, the temerity of men
‘⁶ will cause more evil than good to arise from it.'’

To shew how faithfully the unchangeable Church adheres to such princi-
ples to the present time, it is deserving of notice here, that in 1816 Pope
Pius Vll„ writing to the Archbishop of Gnezn, designatos the Bible So-
