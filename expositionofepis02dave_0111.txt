Ver. 12. Epls'rLE ‘ro 'run cotossmNs. 101

l. Because it behoves one. beloved mutually to love
God: but the proof of love is the exercise of virtue3 [f
γε love me, keep my commandments‚ John xiv. 15.

2. Because it behoves one beloved to frame himself to

the likeness of God who loves him: sor as love arises from
a similitude of dispositions, so does enmity arise from
their dissimilitude.

Corollaries.

l. They who do not cultivate virtue and holiness‚ are
not only impure but sacrilegious3 since they pollute by a
disorderly life, their bodies and soulS, which vvere sacred
to God.

2. It is but folly for one to presume that he is loved of
God, or that he loves God, who neglects to put on the
ornaments of virtue: since they are at once signs of the
Divine love towards us, and of ours towards God. For
God always adorns those whom he loves by infusing vir-
tues and gifts3 and they who love God worship him and
honour him by the exercise of virtue. So much of the
arguments which the Apostle uses as preliminaries to the
exhortation itself.

3. We now come, in the last place, to the matter of
the exhortation contained in these words, Put οη howels (ff
met-cies, lcindness, &a Here it is proper to consider the
act of putting on, and the things or virtues so put 011.

Putye om] This is a figurative expression taken from
garmcnts. But since in things spoken metaphorically we
are not to suppose a similitude in all respects, it will not
be foreign to the matter if we briefly note in what respectis
virtues are like garinents, and in what they are unlike.

They are like: l. Because as garments adorn the body3
so do virtues the soul. 2. Because as he who is stript of
his clothes appears base and mean in the eyes of men; so
does the man stript of virtues, to God, to angels‚ and to
picus men. 3. Because as clothes are not derived from
the human body3 so true virtues are not of the will of man,
but the gift of God. Hence that definition of the 8611001-
111611, Virtue is tlzat good quality (gf (lie mind which couslitules
α virtuous lise, and wlel'clc God worlrs in us, Albert, lib. 5.
