272 AN EXPOSITION or ST. PAUL’S Chap. iv.

noured, although in a wicked man3 yet dishonesty or infi-
delity in the discharge of this ministry, is wont, not only
to alienate our minds from the minister himself, but to
cast a stain even upon the ministry also.

This fidelity, which is commended in Tychicus‚ consists
in two things: in that he always exercised his ministry
both to promote the glory of God, and to advance the edi-
fication of the people of Christ.

Hence we are instructed,

l. They thrust themselves in vain into the ministry,
who in discharging the same do not prove themselves faith-
ful; nay, it is pernicious both to their own welfare and that
of others ε neither shall they receive the prize destined to
teachers, but that woe directed against those who preach
not the gospel.

2. It behoves pious Christians to reverence their minis-
ters, of whatever sort they are3 but highly to love the

their people ; not to excite hatred towards them,

2. It becomes those who are appointed to a more enli-
nent station, not to despise inferior ministers, but to es·-
teem and treat them as their fellow-servants. Thus Paul
from his Apostolic eminence does not despise or depress
Tychicus, much inferior to himself3 but rather exalts him,
and puts him as his equal, by calling him afellow-servant.

3. The Roman pontiff is not the true successor either
