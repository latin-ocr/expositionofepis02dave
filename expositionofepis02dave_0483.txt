THE LAST PROPOSITION STATED AND CONFIRMEI).

WE have exhibited the universal virtue and efficacy of'
the death of Christ, explained in three propositions. In
the first it was demonstrated, That this death of Christ
was appointed by God and proposed to the human race, as
an universal remedy applicable to all rnen individually. In*
the second, we have shewn in what sense Christ is said to
have died for all, or in what sense the 'death of Christunay
be acknowledged to have been established as an universal
cause of salvation, for the good of the whole human race3
namely, not as some assei-t, by reason of its mere suffici-
ency, or intrinsic value, in which respect the death of
Christ, or the blood of the Son of God, is a price more
than sufficient to redeem each and all men and angels3 but
by reason of the Evangelical covenant established and
confirmed by this death and blood of Christ, according to
the tenor of which covenant a right accrued to all men in-
dividually, on condition of saith, of claiming for them-
selves remission of sins and eternal life. To these two
propositions we have subjoined a third, in which it was
shewn, That the universal virtue of the death of Christ
having been stated, and the universal covenant of the Gos-
pel having regard to every man, yet that every individual
person has indeed, by the-sole benefit of this death, God
under obligation to enter into peace with him, and give him
life, if he should believe3 but has not actual justification
or reconciliation, or an actual state of grace and salvafion,
before he believes.

There now reniains afonrtlz and last proposition, which
may serve chiefly for removing any scruple from the minds
