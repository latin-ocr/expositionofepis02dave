ments. In which it is taken for granted, that the death of
Christ is, according to the mode prescribed by God, ap-
plicable to any living person. And should it be objected,
that it is not applicable to any person remaining in impe-
nitence and unbelief, let it be remembered that the non-
application in such cases arises not from the limitation of
the remedy, but because the only mode of application ap-
pointed by God is obstinately rejected. For no remedy
can be available if its application be obstinately refused
and pertinaciously rejected even to the last.

Once more let it be observed, we do not affirm that the
death of Christ at the moment of his dissolution‚ was ac-
tually applied to all and every iudividual of mankind, nor
that after his oblation it was infallibly to be applied, but
that, according to the appointment of God, it is applicable
to all. For God hath ordained that it should be applicable
to every individual through faith, but he hath not deter-
mined to give that saith to every individual, by which it
may be infallibly applied. Why he should give this me-
dium of application to some and not give it to others,
ought not to be inquired, since it cannot be solved3 but
must be referred to the secret will of God. This may suf-
fice for the explanation of our proposition: Let us now
proceed to the proof of it.

fancy, but from the holy Scriptures, that the death of
Christ, according to the will of God, is an universal re-
medy, by the Divine appointment, and the nature of the
thing itself, applicable for salvation to all and every indi-
vidual of mankind. From many testimonies Ι shall select
a few :

world, tlzat lle gave lzis only begolten Son, tlzat wlzosoever be-
lievetlz on him should not pet-ish but have everlasting lg’se. It
is not difficult to deduce every particular of the afore-
mentioned proposition from these words. For, in the first
place, Christ given up by the Father to death, is here
proposed as an universal remedy provided for the whole
world. Then this panacea of the death ‚of Christ is de-
