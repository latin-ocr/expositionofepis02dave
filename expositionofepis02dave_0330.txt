320 Α Dissaa‘ra'rion oN THE DEATn or CHRIST-

Augustine, and others who embraced his doctrine of pre-
destination, that they taught that Christ was crucified for
the predestinate alone, and from this objection of the

Pelagians some in succeeding ages seized a handle for
kindling the afore-mentioned controversy. This is mani-
fest from the objections of the Vincentiansfiss in which this
takes the lead, Tltac our Lord Jesus Clu ist did not su erfor

θ’ Ex objectionibus Vincentianis, the followers of Vincentius Lirinensis,
or St. Vincent of Lerins. He was by birth a Gaul', and a cotemporary with
Augustine, entering the Monastery in the Island of Lerins from the storms
ofa military life, about the middle of the fifth Century3 and, from the place
of his retirement and great sanctity, becoming known as above described. In
his retreat he composed a treatise entitled Commonitorium adversus I-Iaere-
ticos, in which he undertook to shew the folly ofall novel opinions, His pro-
duction obtained celebrity, and was often reprinted in the loth and 17th Cen-
turies. An English Translation of it by the Rev. William Reeves, was pub-
lished in 1709, together with translations of the early Christian Apologists‚
in 2 vols. 8vo. ς the whole is preceded by an able “ Dissertation'' ofabove 100
pages, in correction of Daille's work, “ upon the right use of the Fathers.”
It has been supposed that Vincentius Izz'mseff was opposed to Augustine,
and put forth 16 propositions as erroneous, which he charged upon Augus-
tine and his scholars ι but there is no evidence of this. The work here men-
tioned seems to have been the only production ofhis pen; and the object of
it is to shew, that men should prove the orthodoxy of their saith, first, by
the authority of Holy Scripture, and secondly, by the doctrine of the Ca-
tholic Church. Reeves's translation of Vincentius's treatise appears to have
been undertaken primarily to prove, that Vincentius was no Pelagian, and
that his work was not directed against Augustine's views as had been as-
serted; and secondarily, that it made nothing for the Roman Catholics,
who boasted of his being a Champion for their favourite buttress of Tradi-
tion ε And it is manifest the work was directed against the heresies of! Pho-
tinus, Apollinaris, Pelagius, Nestorius, the Manichaeans‚ and such like:
that he has collected the Rules which the most orthodox Fathers had laid
down as derived from Scripture, to judge of such novelties as these here-
siarchs broached, and even citing some ofSt. Augustiue's rules, triumphantly
supporting the whole by Scriptural examples and testimonies-by patriarchal
and apostolic authority. As to Vincentius’s upholding the authority of the
Romish Chnrch, or sustaining the popish dogma of Tradition, his Transla-
tor has justly observed in his “ Preliminary Discourse” to the treatise,
“ had Vincentius been assisted with a prophetie vision of the future cor-
“ ruptions in the Church of Rome, he could not have expressed himself
“ more clearly against it. The whole design and bent of his book is di-
“ rectly against all innovatione in the Faith, and for cleaving inviolably to
‘⁶ the Creed as then explained, and always understood by the Apostolic
‘⁴ Churches-''—It is indeed a wise and judicious production, and highly de·
