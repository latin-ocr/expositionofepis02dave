whether he who is in this place called the physic-ian, was
the same with Luke the Evangelist3 and seem rather to
incline to the contrary opinion, upon the weight of this
one argument, that the Apostle had bestowed upon him
no honourable title. But this conjecture is too slender to
set aside the common opinion which we derive from the
more aulient Fathers‚ Jerome, Ambrose, Theodoret, and
almost all the rest. Neither is it necessary, that as often
as mention is made of noted men, so often they should be
signalized, by some honourable title. Add to this, that it
appears srom the antients, that this Evangelist was at first
a physician3 nor can another person of his name be found
in Ecclesiastical history who was a work-sellom with Paul,
and α εωηραηίοη of his travels. Thus much of Luke.

And Demea] This Demas in the Epistle to Philemon,
is reckoned among the companions and fellow-helpers of
Paul, vers. 24. There salute tlzee, Marclzus, Aristarchus,
Demus, Lucas, my sellom-labourers. But the same per-
son, in 2 Tim. iv. 10, is accused, because he hadforsalcen
Paul, haring loved this present world, and departed into Thes-
salonica. Dorotheus, in his SynopsiS, shews the cause,
that is to say, to become there an idolatrous priest. He
had perhaps observed that ministers of the Gospel, like
soldiers‚ were at once oppressed by labour and want3 he
therefore betook himself to exercise the priesthood among
the idolatrous heathen, where a greater hope of tranquil-
lity and profit shone upon him. The Apostle dignified him
by no title3 therefore it is not necessary that we should
say moreabout him: we shall only elicit these observa-
tions ;

1. That many greedily embraced the Gospel at the be·
ginning, whom nevertheless afterwards either the fear of
persecution or the love of the world hurried away.

2. That the root of true saith and piety never was in
the hearts of those persons3 according to that saying of
John, l Epist, ii. 19, leey urent out from us, hut they were
not Qf us,- for if they had been os us, they would have conti-
mtecl with us, ἃς. So Cyprian writes, Lib. l. epist. 3, Thac
tlte Clam-elz wleiclz helieves in Christ, never deluens from him ;
