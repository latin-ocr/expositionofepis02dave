5¹22 Α DissssRTATioN οΝ THE DEATH or eunis'r,

Therefore Christ is truly called the Saviour and Redeemer
of the world, inasmuch as he hath brought to the whole
world a saving remedy, which is applieable by saith. But
he is the Saviour and Redeemer of his sheep, his church,
1115 body, in short, of the predestinated children of God,
inasmuch as by his special design he hath destined and
procured this reinedy to be applied to them, by granting
to them that the eyes of cheir understanding should be 611ἰὶςῆ-
tened (Eph. i. 18) that by saith they might possess Christ
effectually united and applied to them.

4. Lastly, we may confirm our opinion by those pas-
sages 111 which God hath absolutely promised to Christ, on
his dying, that by the merit of his death the church should
be infallibly delivered from death, and put in possession of
eternal life. (Gen. iii. 15) The seed eff tlze woman shall bruise
tlze serpent's head. What else does this mean, 11111 that by
the virtue and merit of the death of Christ, Satan should

be trodden down, and all those should be delivered from
his power whom God in Christ willed specially to pity?
Now who can doubt that Christ, by a special design,refer-
red his death, which was to destroy Satan, to those who,
by a special benefit, were 10 116 delivered through him?
But that those who were infallibly to be delivered were the
elect, is allowed by all sound Divines. Rupert (lib. 2,
de victoria Verbi Dei, cap. 18) says, He calls the elect by
name [lie conqueror-s of the Serpeut; because, truly‚ the effi-
cacy of the death and resurrection of Christ to bruise the
devil is of his special mercy destined and procured to be
effectually applied to them alone. From whence Marlo-
ratus>xc says on this passage, The devil and tlte generaliore of

⁸ Augustine 'MARLORAT5 an eminent Protestant divine of the l6th cen-
tury, was born in the dukedom of Lorrain in 1506. Having made great
proficiency in his studies, in a Blonastery of Augustine Friars, whose li-
centious morals appear to have inspired him with a dislike for their religion,
he quitted that monastery, and pursued his studies first in France, and af-
terwards at Lausanne, where he made open profession of the Protestant re-
ligion, and was admitted into the Ministry. He was chosen pastor at
Vevey, and then at Rouen, in Normandy, where 116 contributed to the dif-
fusion of the principles of the Reformation. 111 1561, he was present at
