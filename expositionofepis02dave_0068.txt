58 ΑΝ ΕΧΡοειΤιοΝ OF ετ. PAUL's Clzap.iii.

his adultery with the wife of Uriah? and that other saints
have been grievously punished sor other crimes of theirs'?

I answer, It is not to be denied that even the children of
God, when they give the reins to the fiesh, and yield
themselves to sin of this sort, feel the wrath of God fall-
ing· upon them : but it does not lie perpetually upon them3
because they do not continue in these sins. Yet we must
distinguish concerning the wrath of God: for God sends
his wrath upon his fallen children, but paternally and for
chastisement3 and upon disobedient children as an enemy
and to cut them off. Therefore‚ in these latter words the
Apostle preferred to hold forth examples of the Divine
wrath, that thus he might, indirectly as it were, instil the
sear thereof into the pious. But we must add this also:
When believers rush into sins of this kind against con-
science, although that bond of the eternal good-will of
God which depends upon election is not loosened3 yet
the love of friendship is loosened for a time, or at least
the perception and enjoyment of it, which depend upon
saith and sanctification, Therefore‚ whilst they are asleep
in such sins, God acts towards them as with enemies3 they
are not able to apprehend God otherwise than angry and
hostile towards them : they cannot, therefore, approach the
throne of grace with confidence, but, like Adam, they flee
from God, and throw themselves into hiding-places. There
is need, therefore, of stirring up their saith and love3
there is need of serious repentance‚ to avert the wrath of
God, and obtain the favour and the smile of his counte-
nance: For that declaration of St. Paul is true, Rom. ii.
9, &Q T ribulation and anguislz upon every soal of man that
doeth evil: but glory, honour, and peace to every man that
worketlz good. For there is no respect of persons with God.

From these things we may draw the following instruc-
tions.

1. Under public calamities and miseries, we must not
murmur against God; but impute whatever evils we suffer

to our sins.
2. As often as we are solicited to sin, we should op-

pose to its allurements the consideration of the Divine
wrath, which closely follows sinuers.
