mulgated will of God, there is no redemption from hell.
Therefore, the possibility of having saith, as to every one
who is living in this world, is founded on the virtue of
Christ the head being most sufficient to influence them,
and on the aforesaid mercy of God, who, according to his
common law, is Willing to grant the whole space of this
life for their reception.

Thirdly, and lastly‚ It appears from the different con-
dition of mankind while they are living, and after they
have come to the end of life, that the condition of faith
and repentance, by which the death of Christ is applicable
for salvation to any human being, is possible while they
are in this world. From the consent of all Divines, the
will of any living person may in this world be turned to
that which is good3 as, on the other hand, the will of the ·
damned is in their state immoveably confirmed in evil.
This is clearly the case with respect to both. Nobody
doubts that after this life the state of wicked rnen is im-
moveably fixed and altogether unchangeable. For, as Da-
mascenus rightly says (lib. 2, cap. 4,) What their sall was
to angels, such is death to men. If the tree fall toward the
south, or toward the worth, in the place where the treesalleffl,
there it shall be. (Eccles. xi. 3.) On the other hand, the
will of men placed in this mortal life may be changed, and
their wickedness removed, so that, by the ordinary power
of God, any unbeliever may be enlightened‚ any impeni-
tent may be converted ; in one word, any wicked man may
bejustified and saved. Whence that exhortation of the
Apostle (2 Tim. ii. 25, 26,) In meelcness instructz‘ng those tlzat
oppose themselves ; {f God peradventzcre will give them repen-
tance to the acknowledgz'ng of the truth, and that they may re-
cover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken
captive by him at his will. He inthnates, therefore, that this
may as yet be done, and that it ought to be hoped for by
us. Not dissimilar is that declaration of Peter <2 Epist.
iii. 9,) The Lord is long-srfferz'ng to usward, not willing that
any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. Au-
gustine says (Epist. 54> There is no other placefor the cor-
