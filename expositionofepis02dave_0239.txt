thus expresses himself, Τ lze desire of obtaining what is
songht is tlze voice (ff prayem without this, prayer is dnmh.
But now neither the thought, nor the desire of those things
which are asked‚ is found in those who do not understand
what they ask from God.

Paul condemns those prayers which are not understood3

who concludes that we cannot say Amen to the prayers
which are not understood, l Cor. xiv. 16. Augustine hath

condemned it3 who, in his book De magistro, cap. i. thus
writes, T lte people ought to understand the prayers of their
priests, tlzat they may have their attention street upon God by
a commonfeeling. Even the very Papists themselves among
whom there was any thing of mind or firmness, have cen-
sured this error of the Romanists. Parisiensis, De Rhe· .
tor. Divin. c. 38, where he compares prayer to a messen-
ger, says, It is reckoned among illefollies (ff that messenger‚
that lte neither cares nor thinks of those concerns except this

though involved in the error of the Roman chnrch, denies
this to be necessarily the case as far as regards the illite-
rate3 yet he voluntarily confesses that the conversion of
the heart to God at the time of prayer, all things eonsi-
dered, is more laudable if it be done according to the
words and the meaning of the prayer. Lastly‚ Cajetan is
convicted of error by the theologians of Paris, in having
written that it is better that prayers should be said in the
vulgar and known tongum than in the Latin which is not
