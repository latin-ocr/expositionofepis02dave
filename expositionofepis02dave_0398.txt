Rsspm 1‘2. I deny the antecedent, and affirm that God
in sending the Redeemer was willing to manifest to the
world both these kinds of love; namely, that common love
of the human racc, which we call philanthropy, and that
special and secret love, which we call good pleasure. The
argument of common love is, that he would so far regard
the human race, that is, all men individually‚ that they
should have a Redeemer through whose satisfaction, appre-
hended by saith, they might obtain remission of sins.
This love he did not exhibit to the fallen angels (whom,
nevertheless, he preserves as his creatures), since Christ
was in no wise ordained to be a Redeemer of them, nor is

Redeemer. This is that ordination of the death of Christ,
or of a satisfactory price, which flowed from the common
love of God to all mankind, and therefore, it is rightly de-
clared to be extended, under this condition, from us to all
men individually. And to this we think that celebrated
passage refers, John iii. 16, God so loved the world, &Q

to be effectually and infallibly applied in a special way to
the elect, who are to be redeemed and saved through his
special love. Therefore we attribute to that common love,
with which God waits upon the human race, that he was
