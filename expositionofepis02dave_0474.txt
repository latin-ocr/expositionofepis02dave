464 A DlSSER‘rATloN ΟΝ THE DEATH OF CHRlST.

Divine nature, which is free frorn all kinds of mutability,
no one in his senses will deny: especially since it seems
not only consonant to the dictates of right reason, and
agreeable to the decrees of the sounder philosophy, which
teaches that che same bys tlte same always does the same, that
is, that the same thing being done in the same way always
produces the same effect3 but also may be confirmed and
established by not a few, aud those most beautiful passages
of the holy Scriptures, as from that testimony of the pro-
phet Malacbi (iii. 6,) For I am the Lord, I change n0t3 ac-
cording to Junius, I, Jelzovah, change not. Also of Num-
bers xxiii. 19, God is 7ιοί a man, that he should lie‚· nor tlte

inate only some previous disposition and inclinatior] to fu-
ture pacification and reconcileability, a facility and pro-
pensity in God to reconciliation, which is brought into
action towards believing rnen from his power.

REPLY. That God is reconcileable to any elect person
before his saith and repentance, and is actually reconciled
to him after his faith and repentance‚ does not more argue
a change in God from act to power, than this man’s not
beingjustified until he believes and his being actually jus-
tified after he believes, argues a changeableness in God;
or than his sins being remissible, and after his repentance
being actually forgiven, proves a temporary change of the
Divine essence or will from power to act. For no man
could truly say, because Paul was justified when he be-
lieved in Christ, but was not justified while he was a blas-
