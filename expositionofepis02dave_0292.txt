enough, in Epis. l. cap. v.. vers. 13, where he calls this
Mark his Son: yet he was not his natural, bnt his spiri-
tual son, begotten by the seed of the word. But now let
us examine those things which are hinted by the Apostle
himself.

In the first place, then, he dignifies this Mark by a sur-
name3 Siscer’s son to Barnabas] This Barnabas was an old
and celebrated disciple of Christ, as appears from Acts
i. 23 (see also iv. 36), where, when a consultation was
held about choosing another in the vacant place of the
traitor Judas, this Barnabas, or Barsabas, and Matthias,
were appointed candidates of this apostolic dignity. But
in Acts xi. 24, he is distinguished by a brief but remark-
able enlogy, He was a good man, aad fall of the Holy Ghost
and offaitlz. Therefore it was honourable to Mark to be
so nearly related to such a man.

Secondly‚ Mark is also dignified by the testimony and

visit them: which is more expressly stated in some copies,
where it is read δέξασθαι, not δέξασθε, yse received a command-

prefers this reading, as what plainly indicates what that

command had been.

But it may be enquired, what reason or necessity was
there for this command. Did Mark need commendatory
letters? Or, if Paul had not given this in command,

would he have been rejected by tl e Colossians, if at any
time he had gone to preach to them?

We ausu er, It appears from Acts xv. 38, th lt some dis-
pleasure had happened between Paul and Mark, from the
circumstance that Mark had left him in Pamphylia, and
had not continued his companion in the office of prcach-
ing. This perhaps had been made known to the Colos-
sians: he might, therefore, have been accounted for a de-
serter, unless Paul, rendered in a manner more content,
had commanded them about receiving him. For howso-
ever he had departed from Paul, yet it is very likely he
