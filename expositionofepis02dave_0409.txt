REPLY 17. From the aforesaid testimonies, and others
which are similar, it is well concluded that the death of
Christ, according to the will of God in sending his Son,
and of the Son in offering himself, pertains in a special
manner to the peculiar people who are known only to God,
that is, to the elect. But that special mode is of this
kind, that he cannot be said to have died for these alone,
buthe died for these only with the certain, eternal, gra-
tuitous purpose of infallibly saving them, through the free
gift of his special mercy flowing from some special provi-⁴
dence, which we call predestination. But from testimo-
nies of this kind, which refer to certain persons, the death
of Christ, not considered simply, but complicated with
the decree of secret predestination, it is wrongly inferred‚
that this death does not pertain to all men in some general
way. But the general mode is of this kind, that we should
aeknowledge that Christ died for the whole human race,
with an evangelical covenant, and that a most sure one,
concerning expiating sins and conferring eternal life on
each and every man, provided they should embrace this
Redeemer of the world with a true saith. And hence it is,
that although some passages occur in the holy Scriptures,
in which Christ is said to have died for the elect, or for his
own peculial· people, yet none occur in which it is denied
that he died for any persons, many occur in which it is
asserted that he died for all. For the Spirit of God was
willing to shew to those that believed in the death of
Christ the special privilege ,of the elect, but he was un-
willing to overwhelin in silence the common privilege of
the human race in the same death of Christ. It is our
part, therefore, to leave to God the decree of his secret
predestination, according to which he determined how far,
and to whom, he will effectually apply this death of Christ
by the gift of his special grace3 and in the mean time, to
