masters themselves. There is a well known rule in the ex-
position of the holy Scriptures, In comparisons that z's often
denied which z's not? to be excluded, but only postponed [ο ano-
ther: as in Mar. ix. 37, leosoever receiveelz me, receivetlz not
me, but him that sent me: i. e., he rather receiveth the
Father who sent me, than I who am sent; because he re-
ceiveth me by that grace. So in this place, to the Lord,
and not wito men. i. e. to the Lord Christ, more than to
men ς because for the sake of Christ you serve them.

But why in these lower and external observances are
they said to obey the Lord more than men, whose com-
mands they are, and whom alone they profit?

First, because they who obey are more the servants of
Christ than of earthly masters. For earthly masters buy
their servants for silver and gold3 Christ buys them with
his precious blood ε they redeem the body alone, and that
for another service; Christ redeems both soul and body for
perpetual liberty. They must therefore especially ‘serve
Christ.

Secondly‚ because they obey earthly masters only at the
appointment of Christ3 therefore they rather obey Christ
than thern; not unlike as inferior servants who obey a
steward, yet are said more to obey their master, at whose
will they yield to his steward: he is opposed, if he shall
order the contrary to his master.

Thirdly, because Christ himself hath declared that he
wishes his servants to obey their masters, and this he
strictly commands in his word: and he himself also in his
wise governance and by his authority, hath ordained some
to service and others to dominion. Whilst faithful servants
have respect to all these things, they are rightly said to
serve the Lord and ηοι men.

But now, that this is the most valid reason why they
should do all things heartily, is gathered from hence, be-
cause this supreme Lord, that is to say, Christ, can both
inspect the beart, and he is wont to regard the heart, more
than the external act: It behoves the person therefore who
desires to please him, to do all things heartily. Now let
us collect the instructions in one view.
