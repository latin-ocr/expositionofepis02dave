236 AN ExposurmN ορ s'r. PAUL’s (Παφίη

On these groundS‚ therefore, it is manifest, that thanks-
giving. inasmuch as it is 3 tribute due to God on many ac-
counts‚ is never to be intermitted.

Hence we are taught,

l. That almost all men are more prone to ask and to
complain‚ than to be thankful.

2. That those ungrateful men are wholly unfit to offer

unto God the sacrifice of prayer. ι
3. That good and evil are not to be measured by our

sense, but must be left to the judgment of God our Father:
for here is the fountain of ingratitude, that we do not be-
lieve those things to be best for us which are sent by God.
The old poet was not undeservedly praised by Plato, in
Alcibiades, lib. 2, because he had prescribed to his friends
this form of prayer,
Ο Jupiter, grant to us thy blessz'ugs whether we pra-yser
them or witlahold our prayers,
And repel from us all evils even though we pray for
them.

4. That we must not be rash or angry, if those things
should be denied us which we desire3 but rather give
thanks to God the Father, who lovingly and prudently de-
nies us hurtful things, even when they are foolishly and
inconsiderately sought by us.

5. That nothing can happen to the pious and faithful,
for which they may not and ought not to give the most de-
served thanks ; according to that injunction of the Apostle,
lThess. v. 18, In all things give thanks. Thus much for
the condition of legitimate prayer.
