dcccl most certain in the Hicine predestinatiou from eternity,·
but it is not actually given on the part of God, nor actually
received on the part of man, until he repents and believes.

OBJec'rloN 3. The efficacy itself of the means in some
men rather than in others, arises not from the difference of
free-will, hut from hence, that God was reconciled to all the
elect in Christ before the foundation of the world, but to
others he was not reconciled : Therefore‚ we ought not to
deny that all the elect are actually reconciled to God before
their conversion and faith, since that dispensation derives
its origin and the efficacy of the means to produce in them
saith and repentance, from their eternal and antecedent re-
conciliation.

Ram. We willingly grant that the infallible efficacy
of the means ordained to salvation does not depend upon
the human will, but upon the eterna} and special love of
God towards his own elect. But we assert that this love
does not regard those who are as yet unbelieving and un·—
converted, otherwise than as a gratuitous purpose of pro-
viding for thern, that hereafter they should be converted,
and justified, and reconciled to God, and infallibly brought
to eternal life. It is, therefore, equally false to infer eter-
nal justification, and the eternal reconciliation of the elect,
and their eternal glorification from this eternal love 3 since
from thence ought to be collected only their certain and
infallible justification‚ reconciliation, and glorification 3
which certainty or infallible efficacy of means tending to
salvation, arises from the aforesaid love of God, and not
by virtue of free-will. If any one pleases to call this love,
on which depends the certainty of conversion and recon-
ciliation to be produced in time, actual reconciliation‚ since
God himself calleth. those things which be not as tlzouglz they
were, (Rom. iv. 17) Ι find no fault, provided he allows at
the same time that he calls the purpose of the thing to be
done by the name of the thing done3 because, as Augus-
tine says, It was fixed z'n the predestz'nation <ff God that it
should calce place in his own time. (De Civit. Dei, lib. 12,
cap. 16.)
