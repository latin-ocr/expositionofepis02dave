82 AN EXPOSITlON OF ST. PAUL'S Clzap. iii.

not see that such an one is not free from the guilt of lying
by these trifling reservations? For in a negative proposi-
tion, it is whateveris usually contained in the comprehen-
sion of the predicate that is removed from (i. e. denied of)
the subject3 not a single species only. So that he who
dares to confirm propositione of this kind with an oath,
relying upon his mental resewafflons, is guilty of perjury
by the suffrages of all the antient theologians.

We only now adduce some few rule'S, leaving it to you
to apply thern to this dispute.

Rule 1. By whatever artifice (ff words cm oath is taken,
God accepts ic as he to whom the oath is made understands ic.
Isidore.

2. An oath is received according to the common usage of
language. Gerson, part. 2. But neither he to whom the
oath is made, nor common usage, understands those
clauses of reservation3 and he who offers to make an oath
knows this.

3. No one ought to swear to any thing as certain, says

Durandus 3 for αη oath is calling God to witness for the con-
firmation of the truth (ff what the hearer doubts, and to which
he will not assent on α simple assertion. But there never
was a doubt, whether that. priest was the priest of Apollo:
nor was it needful to profane an oath in proof of it.

4. An oath consisting of many or equz'vocal words, bimls in
that sense which the words are wont to convert) to persons rightly
understanding them. If among such the words equally convey
several sigozg'ficatz'ons‚ then the occth binds in that sense in which
the swearer believed that he to whom the oath was made under-
stoodthem at the time. Altissiodorensis, lib. 3, tract. 19,
qu. 4.

From all these instances we conclude, that notwithstand-
ing the mental reservation, the material of a lie exists in
that assertion of the priest‚ viz. his false proposition.

But, in the second place, the Jesuit answers, The lz'e
does not ea’istformally in this example .- for he did not intend
to deceive his hemer, but preserve himself from danger, in cle-
wying he was α priest, with the tfforesaz‘d mental reservation.

Butwc rcply, he intended both of these3 sor he would
