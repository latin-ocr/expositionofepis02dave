proud: viz. that he accounts them his greatest enemies,
and pursues them with his wrath even to destruction. He
destrqzss tlze house of the proud, Prov. xv. 253 God resz'stetli
the proed, &a l Pet. v. 5. From which Gregory, on that
passage 1 Sam. xv. 17, WHEN THou wAsT LITTLE IN
THlNE OWN EVES, says, Thou wast great in mine eyes, he-
cause lowly in- tlzz'ne own : now art thou abased before me, be-
cause great in tliz'ne own sight. Therefore how much any
one is precious in his own eyes, by so much he becomes
more base before God.

Lastly, if we bear in mind that pride is the poison of all
virtues, and of all good deeds. Whence Augustine (on
Ps. xciii.) concludes, Humilily z‘n evil deecls is more pleasing
to God, than pride in good ones. He, therefore, who com-⁴
hines other virtues without humility, does but bear chaff
against the wind. On this account God determined that it
was better for his holy Apostle to be buffetted by Satan,
than to be inflated by the sin of pride, 2 Cor. xii. 7.

Meelcness, long-suffering] These two virtues are the
daughters of hnmilz'ty, of which we have the greatest need
in adversity, and when we have business with morose, re-
proachful, and wicked men3 for they become as a shield
to us. As to meelcness; it is that virtue which renders a
man manageable in common intercourse, and prevents him
from being¹ exasperated beyond measure and justice at the
follies, stubbornness, and lighter faults of others, even
when they tend to his own injury or disadvantage. It is
such a moderator of passion, that it absolutely restrains
what is unjust, and so tempers aud softens what is j'ust,
that it is neither rashly excited, nor borne headlong be-
yond its proper limits. A humble-ininded man (πραος) is
not badly described by Aristotle, Ethic. 4, 5, when he says
that he is not driven headlong by unbridled passion, but is
angry sofar, so long, and against tlze person right reason en-

joz'ns; and, in a word, z's not given to revenge, but rather
easy to be appeased.

We must strive after this virtue on many accounts.
