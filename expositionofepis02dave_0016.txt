other from the exaltation of Christ3 where Clu-ist sitteth ac
the ⁷·21ghthandcff God. For the despising earthly things
two others are used3 the first derived from our spiritual
death 3 Ye are dead, and-your life is hid with Christ, vers. 4 ;
the latter, from the expectation of our life of glory 3 When
Christ, who is our lffe, shall appear, then shall με also appear·
with him in glory.
1. Of the duties‚ ,

Seelc those things which are above] The word Seeh indi-
cates labour and effort3 and, to use the scholastic phrase,
excludes sluggz'sh willingness. By the things which are above
we must understand, in the first place, the kingdom of
heaven, or the beatific vision of God, and those pleasures
to be hereafter enjoyed with Christ our Head and the

For he who does not advance in saith, love, and holin-ess,
he does not, by the whole course of his life, seek heaven,

but hastens to hell.

Hence we infer,
1. That heaven is not given to the indolent, but to

those who seek it by great labour, Seelc με the kingdom of
God, ancl his righteousness, Matt. vi. 33. And elsewhere,
the violent tasse it, not those who slumber.

2. Celestial pleasures are not possessed in this life: we
should, therefore, long after and patiently expect those
