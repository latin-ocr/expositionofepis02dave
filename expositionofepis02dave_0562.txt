552 Α DissssflTATloN oN THE DEATH OF CHRIST,

merits os the passion of Christ were imputed or applied to
some men before they believed. But this is contrary to the
received opinion os Divines, which asserts that saith is an
instrument or medium, without which the merits of the
passion of Christ are not applied to individuals. It is ne-
cessary, therefore, that this act of saith should exist,
which may have the merits of Christ specially applied οι·
imputed to it. How, then, can this special application of
the merits of Christ to the elect, who are not yet made
faithful and believing‚ be applied?

REPLY. In order to meet this objection, let us make
the words os the Apostle (Eph. i. 3) the foundation of our
remarks, God laath blessed us with all spiritual blessz'ngs in
Christ, that is, whatever saving good comes to us from
God, is given to us through Christ and for the sake os his
merits. Therefore, since saving saith itself, which is pe-
culiar to the elect, is to be placed among the chief spiri-
tual blessings, it ought to be granted, that it is given on
account of the merits of Christ, to all those to whom it is
actually given. Theresore, what Divines commonly say,
that saith is the instrument, by means os which the merits
of Christ are applied to us, is to be understood of its ap-
plication, as it is considered on the part of men: For the
elect cannot apply to themselves the merits of Christ in
order to the reception of any spiritual benefits whatever,
unless through saith being first supposed to be in them.
But. if we consider the application or imputation on the
partos God alone, then we say, That God both can and
does apply, that is, impute and communicate to men the
merits of Christ, so that, from regard to those merits‚ he
gives to them spiritual good thingS, even when they are
reckoned impious and uubelieving. For saith, when it is
first given, is not given to a believer‚ but to an unbeliever;
but it is given to the elect on account of the merits of the
Mediator. Theresore we must necessarily consess, that
none of the elect can, by believhrg, apply to themselves
the merits os Christ in order to the fruition os eternal life,
unless God os his special mercy should, on account os the
merits of Christ, first give them saith whtreby they may
