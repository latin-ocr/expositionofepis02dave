CHAP. III. Verses 1, 2.

If με then be risen with Clm'st, seek those things which. are
above, where Cltrisc sittetlz on tlte right ham] of God.

Set your affkction on things above, not οη tlzz'ngs on elie
earth.

Having established the doctrine of the Gospel, and van-
quished the seduoers, the Apostle comes to the business
of exhortation, that he might train to holiness oflife those
whom he had brought to hold the truth of faith. But this
exhortation arises and is deduced from the twelfth and thir·
teenth verses of the preceding Chapter, where these words-
occur, Buried witlz him in baptism, wlzo hatte. also raised ancl
quickened you: hence he now infers, nye be risen wiblc
Christ, seelc those things toleiclz are aliove. We have said that
the first branch of the general exhortation is included in
the four first verses3 and has for its object to excite the =2
Colossians to aim at and desire the true good, viz. what is
spiritual and divine3 and, moreover‚ to beget in them a
contempt of apparent good things, viz. corporeal and
earthly ones. And the Apostle acts prudently in prescrib-
ing and defining, in the first place, the thirst for the true
end: since inordinateness of the will as to the end, engen-
ders inordinate and monstrous actions through the whole
course of our life3 for as the form is the principal in natu-
ral things, so the end is in morals.

But to come to the matter itself, here are two things to
be observed by us.

]. The duty to which we are excited by the Apostle,
comprehended in three precepts: Seek those things which
are above3 φρονεῖτε, i. e. tlzz'nlc upon and love tlte things above,·
seelc vot after, neither mind, eartlzly things.

2. The inducements, 01· motives (as they say) to the
performance of this duty. For the seeking and loving the
things above, two inducements are brought: one taken
from our resurrection3 vers. 1, Ye are risen wille Christ: the
