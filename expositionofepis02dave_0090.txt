servati0n3 then we shall convict them of manifest lying.
Let us then assume that any Popish priest interrogated
whether ᾖε ᾖε a priest or not, should answer expressly‚ nay,
swear if it be necessary, that he is not a priest3 ᾖε having
reserved this thought in his mind, that he is nota priest of
Apollo; or, that he is not such a priest as he desires to be;
or, that he is not a priest bound to declare this to others:
I ask whether he is guilty of alie. That most lying Jesuit
Pau-sons, in his Tract‚ ad mitigat. spectss Sco. cap. 8, denies
that he is. We affirm it, and we prove it from that defini-
tion of Augustine and the Schoolmen: For, he voluntat-ily
(mnozmces a falselzood, and that witlz tlze intention of deceiving.
There is the material of lying3 for he denies that ᾖε is
what ᾖε is : there is also the form ,· for by this denial he
intends to impress a false opinion on the mind of his hear-
er. What has the Jesuit to reply to this W

³* The history of the man here referred to, and who figured principally
in the time of Queen Elizabeth, is as extraordinary as the principles which
he maintained to serve the Church, at that time, were horrible, and his con-
duct base and mischievous. His proper name appears to have been Robert
Person. He was born iu 1546, at Nether Stowey, in Somersetshire, where
his father is said to have been a blacksmith. He however obtained —an Uni-
versity education‚ having been a student at ssaliol College, Oxford, where
he took his degrees in arts, and obtained a Fellowship. According to Ful-
ler, he was expelled from his post with disgrace, having been charged with
embezzlement of the College money. He then went to Rome, and entered
into the Order of the Jesuits, and in 1579, ᾖε returned to England as su·
perior of the Catholic Missionaries. Two years afterwards, he was obliged
to leave the kingdom hastily, in consequence of his political intrigues, when
he again took refuge at Rome, where he was placed at the head of the
English College. l-lis political sagacity and active disposition induced
Philip II. to employ him in some preliminary measures at the time of his
projected invasion of England by the “ Invincihle Armuzia ,2³⁹ and, after the
failure of that scheme, Parsons rendered himself formidable to the govern-
ment of Queen Elizabeth by his attempts to promote insurrection, and pro-
cure the assassination of that Princess. He seems, however, to have car-
ried on his plots with a degree of cantion that argued a prudent regard for
his own safety. From Camden's State Trials it appears that when Parsons
came to England to head the party for pushing the treasonable practices
determined on against the Queen, he at first so far proceeded without re·
serve to develope his schemes, that the Government was soon obliged to
take active measures to counteract the proceedings of the iniquitous band ;
and to avoid scizure (as some even of the Papists meditated delivering him
