THE

JUDGMENT OF BISHOP DAVENANT..

aTHE gracious and saving will of God towards sinners
is to be considered, as effectually applying to some per-
sons, of his special niercy, the means of saving grace,
according to that saying of the Apostle, He harh morey on
whom he wz'll; or, as appointing sufficiently for all, of his
common philanthropy, the means of saving grace, appli-
cable to all for salvation, according to the tenor of the
covenant of grace, as the Evangelist has said, God so lovea
the world, &a Those whom the Divine will or good plea-
sure embraces under the first description, on them it ai-
ways confers the means of saving grace in this life, and the
end of grace, that is, life eternal, or glory, in the world to
come (Rom. viii. 28, 29, &C.; Eph. i. 3—5, διε. Those whom
the Divine will embraces only under the latter description,
on them it sometimes confers the means of saving grace,
and sometimes does not; but it never confers the end of
grace, that is, eternal life.

Cameron, the first member of the sentence is legitimately
