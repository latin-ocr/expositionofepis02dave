Ver. 12. EPISTLE To THE conossmxs. 291

of God, except he who both kuows the will of God, and
studies to perform it with all his might. For the will of
God is, that we may know those things which he has re-
vealed for our salvati0n3 it is als-o the will of God, that
we should do those things which he commands to be done
in obedience to him. Of the knowledge of the Diviue
will the Apostle thus speaks in Ephes. v. 17, L'e not un-
wise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. Of
obedience to it, the Saviour, in Mart. vii. 21, says, Not
every one that saith unco me Lord‚ Lora, shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of ‘my Father
which is in heaven. And these are two great blessings.
The third bles'sing which he supplicates for the Colossians
is perseverance in the aforesaid perfection. *And rightly Ι
indeed : for he alone who shall have persevered in good, shall
be saved, Matt. xxiv. 13. All—'your past actions go [br nothing
is what you began has not been brought to perfectiore, says
Cypriam, De bono patient.
Instructions.

l. We should pray God for those to whom we wish
well, not that they may have either the riches or the ho-
nours of this world, but knowledge and obedieuce to the
Divine will.

2. We must beware that we are not contented with
either bare and useless knowledge, or a certain blind obe-
dience : for neither will render us perfect and complete in the
will (ff God.

3. Perseverance in good is a special gift of Divine
grace: For if ic weresrom man, we should not he obliged to
seek itfrom God, says Augustine, De corr. et grat.

But here a doubt arises‚ about the knowledge and ful-
ness of the Divina will: For since Epaphras prays that the
Colossians may stand perfect r'n all the will of God, it may
be asked, whether a perfection of this kind can fall to the
Christian in this life?

Itis auswered, That absolute perfection is not to be
found in our pilgrimage here ; yet we must always attempt
and aspire after it, Christ being the author, who teaches
us to pray, Let thy ‘cvill be done in earth, as z'c z's in heaven.
