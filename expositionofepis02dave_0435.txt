the same, that Christ saffered sor (ιη-ι] one, and tlzat he dem-eea
that lze should itejalle'bly be saved hy his passion. Prosper (ad
Capit. Gallor. resp. 9) The Savz'onr is most rightly said lo
have been crucg'fied for the reclemption oftlze whole world. Yet
he also affirms, (Sent. 9) Althoaglz tlze blood of Christ be tlte
ransom of the whole world, yet they atie excladed from its be-
mefit, who, being cleliglzted with tlzez‘r captivit-y, are unwilling to
be redeemed by it. So tlzat (ff these it may be traly said, tlze
Redeemer os the world gave lais blood for tlte world, and tlte
world would not be redeemed. (Ad Cap. Gallor„ resp. 9.)
Prosper, then, did not think these two things one and the
same3 that Christ was crncffied for these persons, and that
Clu-ist will procare that these persons shall be ilfallc'bly saved.
Theophylact‚ on Heb. ii. 9, God gave his own Son to deacltfor

to bring about by this his death the salvation of all effec-
tually and infallibly3 because he may with sufficient truth
and propriety be said to die for any one, who dies to pro-
cure the good of another, although the other by his own
fault may not receive any advantage from it. The particle
for denotes respect to another in the will and intention of
the person dying, but does not perpetually and necessarily
involve in it such a respect, that no one can be rightly said
to die for another, but he who determines by his death ab·
solutely and infallibly to deliver the other from death.
What if under any condition he should make deliverance
from death possible to guilty men, which without his death
was impossible? Would it not be justly affirmed for that
reason alone, that he died for thern? Ambrose has as-
serted, in writing on Cain and Abel, (ii. 3), that Christ
comesor tlte salvation (ff all, ancl under-took tlze redemption (ff
