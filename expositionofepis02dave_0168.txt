As it isfit in tlze Lord] These words contain either the

reason of the aforesaid injunction, or rather the limitation.
If the reason, they must be explained in this manner3 Be
subject to your own husbands, because Christ your Lord
has so commanded you, whose ordination it is just that
Christians should obey. But concerning this Divine ordi-
nation we have spoken. If, therefore, 'these words contain
a limitation, (which I rather approve) then they are to be
explained thus3 Be subject to your husbands, not abso-
lutely, and promiscuously in all things, but as far as God
permits‚ or as far as it is befitting women who are in the
Lord, that is, believers and Christians.

The occasion of this limitation springs from the circum-
stance, that many believing women were united to unbeliev-
ing husbands, whom they were bound to obey, so far as it
could be done, without the violation of their faith and the
Christian religion. For if an unbelieving husband should
attempt to compel his wife to an idolatrous worship, she
must resist, and be governed by that rule of Peter, Acts
v. 29, We must obey God rather than man. There is the
same reason, if the husband attempt to entice his wife into
any sin: for it is not fit that those who are in the Lord,
should obey in such things. The foundation of this ex-
ception is, That all authority and superiority is derived
from God3 and subordinate to the Divine authority: The
command of the inferior power, therefore, does not oblige
us to obedience when it is contrary to that of the superior,
as Durandus well observes, lib. 2. dist. 39. qu. 5. That
saying of Gregory, therefore, is always to be retained, lee
wg'fe should so please the will qflzer husband, as not to displease
tlte will of her Creator.

Corollaries from this limitation.

1. Wives obedient to their husbands by this due sub-
jection‚ render a submission grateful to God himself3 be-
cause they are subject not only for their own sake, but
much more in the Lord and for the Lord's sake.

2. The wife is bound to her husband to be a companion
