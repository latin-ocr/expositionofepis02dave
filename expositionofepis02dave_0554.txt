544 A nissuaTATmN on THE DEATH OF curum,

many things which greatly conduce to the illustration of
our opinion3 this especially z As the Wordforesaw that his
passion would be offered to the Fatherfor the elect, so he ‹ffired
it effectually in the event, and the whole sI'rinz'ty effectncdly ac-
cepted his passionfor them ; andfor no others was it effectually
offered, nor from eternity accepted. Seotus acknowledges,
that, according to the eternal decree of the whole Trinity,
the passion of Christ was offered andaccepted in some
singular way, and with some special intention for the
elect·

TEST. 5. Hugo de St. Victor (de Sacr. fid. lib. l, part.
8, cap. 7, where he has a treatise on the passion of Christ)
writes thus: Hnman nature was corrupted ln( sin, ond alto-
gether under the sentence (ff condemnation through sin: and
therefore if all had been condemned, there would have been no
injztstice. But grace came, and chose some out of the mass (ff
mankind through mer-cy to salvation, and left others through
justice z'n conclemnalz‘on. Hugo plainly teaches that Christ
in coming into the world and offering himself for the sins
of the human race, had a special regard to the elect, whom
he chose from the niass of mankind3 and whom, according
to the eternal good pleasure of God, he determined to
bring to salvation through the merite of his death, and does
always actually bring them to it,

TEST. 6. Cajetan, in explaining Rom. viii. 32, He that
spared not his own Son, but delivered him upsor us all, how
shall he not with him also freely give us all things? writes
thus, Paul had perceived that the qforesaid argument of
so many gt‘fts did not effectually irffer that God worked ALL
'rHiNGs to the elect for good ; but that God worked for
good to them ; and therefore tlzat he might effizctually con-
clude that it was with respect to ALL rumas, he added,
that God had freely given even his Son for the elect, that
thence he might infer that all things were given with the Son to
the elect. These words of Cajetan cannot be accommo-
dated to that universal giving of Christ, by which it is
understood that he was equally given for the whole world:
for this being granted, God would equally give all things
