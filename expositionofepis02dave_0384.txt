374 Α DisSERTATloN ΟΝ THE DEATH OF CHRIST-

stowed upon them. Although, therefore, in some special
way, the death and resurrection of Christ, with the great
treasure of his merits, may be restricted to the elect alone
(of which we shall discourse afterwards), yet it is not to be
denied that the death and merits of Christ, who took tlze
one nature of all, and under-took the one cause of all, are of
that kind, that they may be announced, offered, and by
faith applied to every individual partaker of human nature.
This Christ himself hath indicated in a manner sufficiently
clear, in those words, John iii 17, 18, God sent not his Son,
into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through
him might be saved; he that believetlz on him is not condemned,-
hut he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hatlz
not believed in the name of the only begotteu Son of God,
Those, therefore, who never believe, nor will believe,
would nevel-theless have had life procurable through the
death and merits of Christ, according to the ordination of

sins of the whole human race. But this cannot be de-
fended, without at the same time overthrowing thejustice
of God, since the idea ofjustice does not admit that the
same sin should be punished twice. Suppose, then, that
the death of Christ is a ransom, by which satisfaction was
made to God for the sins of the human race, how can so
many persons be called to account for the same by the
justice of God, and be tormented with eternal punishment?

REPLY 5. As to the major proposition, we think its
consequence may be safely conceded. For the orthodox
Fathers boldly assert that Christ made satisfaction for the
sins of the human race or of all mankind. Thus Eusebius,
(Evang. Demonstr. lib. x. in the preface) It was needjul that .
the Lamb qs (jod should he offered as α sacrifice jor the
other [aurbs whose maure he assumed, evenfor the whole human
rore. Thus Nazianzen (Orat. 2. in Pasch.) The sacrifice of
Christ z's au imperishable expiation of the whole world. Thus.
