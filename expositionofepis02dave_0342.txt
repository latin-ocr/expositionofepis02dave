But indeed it is neither true nor credible that so many
learned men could be so deceived by Faustus, as to ap-
prove of Pelagian doctrine by his vote. I say these things,
not because I wish to condemn as errors those things
Which are thought to be defined in this chapter by Faus-
tus on the death of Christ, under the approbation of those
Synods, but lest any one, in a controverted point, should
attribute too much to the authority, or rather, to the bare
name of Synods, of which we have nothing certain from
remains worthy of credit. This also is* an argument with
me, that those Fathers of Arles and Leyden, could not
have sanctioned, under so grievous an anathema, that no
one should preach that Christ died only for the elect, be-
cause in the commentaries of the Fathers who lived in the
subsequent ages, that mode of speaking is often found, or
at least is left in doubt. Remigius of Rheinis, on the Sth
of Romans, at the wordS‚ He who spared not His own
Son, lnctsreelzj delivered him up for us all, says, sor us all,
that is, for those who are predestinaled to eternal lffe. And

in explanation, Understand‚for tlze elect. Yet, that there
was some difference at least in the mode of speaking among
the Doctors of that age, appears from this same Remigius.
For on those words which are in Hebrews ii. 9, Thac He
should laste death for every man, he writes thus, Some
Doctors understand tlzis absolutely, that it means for allfot·
whom He tasted it, tlzat is, for tlte elect, wlzo are predestinated

tasted deathsor all, believz'ng aud nnbelieving, saaing, He died
z‘ndeedfor all, though all will not he saved. Gregory the
Great, in one and the sanie Homily (Ez. l. l. Hom.2.) calls
Christ lee Redeemer of mankind, and tlze Redeemer of all,
and yet afterwards subjoins, leat this Redeemer of all deli-
vered himself to death for the lise os the elect. To these two
Ι will add Haimon, Eishop of Halberstadt‚ who fiourished
about the year of Christ 850, and who in his Commenta-
ries so touches upon this controversy, that he determines
nothing certain on either side. On the 5th chapter of the
latter Epistle to the Corinthians, he says, Christ came into
