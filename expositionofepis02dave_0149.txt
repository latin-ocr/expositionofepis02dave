not for ridiculous and profane trifling, but for our advan-

tage and that of our brother. Thus much of the first
use.

2. Admonzkliz'tzg, νουθετοιῗντες] This is the second use,
and releites to manners. The Apostle, then, wishes that
Christians imbued with the knowledge of the Scriptures,
should from thence derive the rule of manners3 and (when
it is necessary) advise their brethren according to it, about
the exercise of virtues, the avoiding of faults, ancl breaking
off their sins. For this duty of mutual admonition and
correction devolves upon all the pious. I will {each sinners
thes ways, &Q Psal. li. 13. Thou shalt not hale thy brother
in thine heart; thou shalt in any wisc rebuhe thy nez'ghbour,
and not sqffer sin upon him, Levit. xix. 17 3 If any man obey
not our word hy this Epistles—-yet count hz'm not as an enemy, '
bnt admonish him as a brother, 2 Thess. iii. 14, 15. They
who neglect this even participate in other men’s sins : For
truly says‘Prosper, De vita contemplat. 3. 23, I sin among
allsinners, when from a certain cruel malz'gnz'tzs of mind I do
not repr-ove them whom I lcnow to have sinned, or to sin. The
Schoolmen lay down many conditions of legitimate correc-
tion. In correcting or admonishing another, they require
aptitude for correction, meekness in correcting, a certain
knowledge of the fault, a probable hope of the amending
of the offender, suitability of the time, and weight of of-
fence. But the ScrIptures require before all other things,
charity and meekness in instructing and admonishing breth-
ren. Jf any one be overtaken in a fault, yse who are spiritual
restore such a man in the spirit queelcness‚ Gal. vi. 1. To
this that rule of Augustine in Expos. epist. ad Gal. has
respect: The cffice (ff reproving another’s sin is never to be
undertaken, unless our conscience shall clearly answer lnffme
God, that we clo itfrom love : sor whatever you shall Say with
bitterness of spirit, is ‘the attach of one who punishes, not the
charity ff a corrector.
