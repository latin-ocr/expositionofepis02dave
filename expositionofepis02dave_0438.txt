condition, is abundantly sufficient for this purpose, that it
may be truly asserted that Christ suffered for all men.
Nor is this conditional decree confirmed by the death of
Christ and extended to all men, a thing of no value, be-
cause the infallible fulfilment of the condition depends
upon another secret decree3 since that secret decree‚ in-
asmuch as it relates to this or the other individual, is al-

Some persons, fixing the eyes of their mind solely on the
secret of predestination and reprobation, cannot conceive
how Christ, faith‚ reniission of sins, eternal life, οι· any
spiritual and saving good, can in any way, or under any
possible condition, pertain to those who were not included
in the number of the preclestinated before the foundation
of the world3 although Christ may be offered to them in
the preaching of the Gospel, although saith may be re-
