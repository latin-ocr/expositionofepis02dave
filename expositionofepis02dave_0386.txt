to every individual‚ and all those other things which regard
the infallible application of this sacrifice which was offered
up for the human race. But since God himself of his own
accord provided that this price should be paid to himself,
it was in his own power to annex conditions, which being
performed, this death should be advantageous to any man,
not being performed it should not profit any man. There-
fore no inj ustice is done to those persons who are punished
by God after the ransom was accepted for the sins of the
human race, because they offered nothing to God as a satis-
faction for their sins, nor performed that condition, with-
out the performance of which God willed not that this sa-
tisfactory price should benefit any individual. Nor, more-
over, ought this to be thought an injustice to Christ the
Mediator. For he so was willing to die for all, and to pay
to the Father the price of redemption for all, that at the
same time he vvilled not that every individual in any way
whatsoever‚ but that all, as soon as they believed in him,
should be absolved from the guilt of their sins. Lastly,
Christ, in offering himself in sacrifice to God the Father in
order to expiate the sins of the world, nevertheless sub-
mitted to the good pleasure of the Father the free distri-
bution and application of his rnerits, neither was any agree-
ment entered into between the Father and the Son, by
which God is bound to effect that this death of Christ,
which, from the ordination of God, is applicable to all
under the condition of faith‚ should become applied to all
by the gift of faith. We ought not, therefore, to deny
that the offering of Christ once made is a perfect satisfac-
tion for the sins, not of some men only, but of all; yet so
that he who is simply said to have died for all, promises
remissiori of sin through his death and salvation condi-
tionally‚ and will perform it to those alone who believe. We
will illustrate all these things by a similitude3 Suppose
thata number of nien were cast into prison by a certain
King on account of a great debt‚ or that they were con-
demned to suffer death for high treason3 but that the
King himself procured that his own Son should discharge
this debt to thc last farthing3 or should substitute himself
