404 A DissER‘rA'rioN ΟΝ THE DEATH 01³ CHRIST-

and tlzatsor all ; but wz'llz tlze conditional, and not tlze absolute
ordination which we have expressed. In one word, when we
affirm that Christ died for all sufficientiy, we mean, That
there was in the sacrifice itselfa sufficiency or equivalency‚
yea, a superabundance of price or dignity, if it should be
compared to the whole human race3 that both in the offer-
ing and the accepting there was a kind of ordination, ac-
cording to which the aforesaid sacrifice was offered and
accepted for the redemption of all mankind. This may
suffice for the explanation of the first term.

Secondly3 That is also to be explained, which is stated
in the proposition; namely, Thai tlzrougli tlie merit of the
death (ff Christ, a new covenant was entered inco between G od
aud the human race. By this covenant we understand that

tles published to the whole world, and the ministers of thet
Gospel preach at the present time, there is no difference
of persons made. As well Esau shall be saved, if he
should believe in the Messiah, as Jacob shall be condem-
ned if he should not believe. But it is to be confessed,
that there is also another ordination of God, secret and
absolute, regarding certain definite persons, and founded
likewise on the death of Christ, which obtains the name of
the new cooenant. But this is understood rather as agreed
upon between God the Father and Christ, than between
God and us. For it is that. which is related by the Pro-
