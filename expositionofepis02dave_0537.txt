should say, that God so gave his Son to death, that at the

same time he had no certain purpose of saving any meu by

the merit of his death 3 but having procured the bare pos-

sibility of salvation, through the death of Christ, for all

plication of his death : 'l'herefore he merited these special
benefits for those persons: Therefore he intended to merit
them when he made himself a sacrifice on the cross. Nor
is it lawful to think rashly or by chance, That Christ pro-
cured greater spiritual benefits for some than for others.
What will our opponents say to this? Will they say that
