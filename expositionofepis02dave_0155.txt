Ver. 17. EplsTLE To THE coLosslANS. 145

this man's religionis vain. Hence also the Psalmist, xii. 4, at-
tributes an unrestrained tongue to those who have cast off
all fear of God ς T lzeys say, Wiclz οιιν tongues will we prevail, our
lips are ραν own ,· who is Lord over us ? Hence, lastly, it is
that the tongue of the glutton is read of as being most
bitterly tormented in hell; namely, because it was unwil-
ling to be regulated and restrained in this world. For thus,
observes Cyprian, Lib. 1. epist. 3, Among all parts qf tlze
body, tlze mouth and tlte longae (ff Dives eadm-e the greatest
punishment ; because forsooth by his mouth and his tongue lte
had most sinned. Which also Gregory remarks, Moral l.
cap. 5, Because atfeasts babblz'ng is onostly wonc to issue, tlte
punishment indicates tlte guilt, when lle affirms that he wlzo
feasted splendidly every day, burned most in leis tongue- It is .
evident, therefore, that the tongue, or our discourse‚ must
be conformed to a rule.

Now as to the works, whether external or internal ;
they ought without doubt to be conformed to his rule: for
if we must speak according to rule, then much more must
we work. The actions of all creatures are performed ac-
cording to a prescribed rule: human actions, therefore,
ought much more to be subject to rule. - Those axioms are
known and approved by all: Every work of nature is tlte
workof intelligerem all nature works as if actuaced by tlte
mind cffsome infallible agent. Yea‚ we see not only brute
animals‚ but the very elements‚ perform as well as intermit
all their operations at the command and the good pleasure
of God their Creator. From which, as it were c'cfortiori,
it is concluded, that all human actions must be directed
after the rule of the Divine will. And thus much concern-
ing the matters to be regulated 3 which is whatever we do,
in word, or deed. Now let us consider the rule proposed in
this place. ”

2. And it consists in two particulars. The former ad-
vises how we should conduct ourselves towards Christ3
namer, so, that we do all things in his name. The latter,
how to behave towards God3 namely‚ so as to give thanks
in all things to God the Father. We shall discuss these
two branches of the proposed rule separately.
