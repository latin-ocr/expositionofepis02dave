least been effected with God, that he is willing to be re-

conciled to any man who believes and repents, to pardon

his sins, and to confer upon him eternal life. Hence, on the

part of God, remissiori was prepared for Cain, if he should

do well· and repent. (Gen. iv. 7.) Hence it is said to any

wicked man in the name of God himself, [ftlze wicked will
turn from all his sins that he bath committed, he shall surely

live, he shall not die. (Ezek. xviii. 21.) Take away the re-

gard to the death of Christ which is present to the mind

of God and which embraces the human race, and there is

nothing serious, solid, or true in promises of this kind as

to the non-elect. For the conditional promise ofremission

ought to have its truth in the death of Christ as much as

the remissiori itself, which is granted on the performance

of the condition. Nor does it at all avail to'diminish the-
universal efficacy which the death of Christ hath obtained

with God, that none of the non-elect fulfil the evangelical

condition of faith and repentance; for it is sufficient, that

by virtue of the death of Christ, and the ordination of
God established through it, if the condition should be ful-
filled by any man whatsoever, the benefit of remissiori and

of eternal life would undoubtedly follow.

Now as to the latter of these, It is also certain and directly
connected with it, That any man whatsoever, through the be-
nefit of the death of Christ, may claim to himself this right,
that if he should believe, immediately all his sins are blot-
ted out, and he is adopted as an heir of eternal life. For
although on account of the want of fulfilment of the
condition many cannot actually claim these promised
blessings, yet there is no human being to whom they would
not ab-ound by virtue of the death of Christ, if the condi-
tion were fulfilled by him. This conditional decree of
God, established by the death of Christ and revealed in
the Gospel, from which we understand that God, by vir·
tue of the passion of Christ, has obliged himself to give
remissiori of sins and eternal life to every one that believ-
eth, and from which an universal right has arisen, not to
certain persons in particular, but to any individual of the
human race, to obtain remissiori of sins under the aforesaid
