α child is something of the father, as Aquinas says, Qu.
disp. de pecc. orig. art. 83 and by the authority of Aris-
totle, his own beloved. It is therefore against the. inclina-
tion of nature itself, that a father should aim to wound and
provoke his own children, whom it behoves him to love
and cherish.

But neither must we omit that this consideration of the
persons ought also to incline the children themselves to
patience and equanimity‚ when harshly and cruelly treated ε
for the cruelty of the father towards his child is a heavy
sin, but the wrath and fury of a child towards his father is
excessively monstrous. Hence Cicero, in his oration for
Cluentius, said, that children should ηοι only conceal the in-
juries of tlzeir parents, but hear them wz'tlz equanimily. And
thus far we have explained tlie prohibition itself: Now let
us consider the cause of the prohibition.

Lest they be (liscoztraged, or lest they become faz'nt-liearled]
The cause of the prohibition is derived from the disadvan-
tage of provocation. And its great disadvantage is shewn:
foi· when children are treated in this manner by parents,
for the most part they fall under discouragement.

This discouragement, αὲυμια, comprises three evils: l.
That hcaviness and sadness of mind into which that cru-
elty of their parents is wont to plunge their children, es-
pecially pious children. Hence oftentiines diseases spring,
and sometimes their premature death. For as a ‘molli lznrt-
eth α garment, and a worm, u·ood; so does sadozess the beart,
Prov. xxv. 20. Therefore‚ parents must strenuously guard
against this disadvantage, lest they should seem to have
begotten children only for the purpose of having persons
on whom they might inflict torment. And that paternal
goodness of God is to be imitated, who would have obe-
dience shewn to himself from his children with alacrity and
Joy, not with sorrow and distress: The same disposition
ought to prevail in earthly parents.

2. This discouragemenc comprises that dejection and
stupidity of mind, which makes them fearfnl, and unfit to
enter upon any work. For children are terrified by the
cruelty of their parents, and finding that themselves and
