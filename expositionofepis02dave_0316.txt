Vers. 18.

ΤΙιε salutation by the hand of me Ραιιῖ. Remember my
bonds. Grace be withyou. Amen.

In this last verse of this Epistle‚ the Apostle does three
things. 1. He shews that he himself had written his usual
salutation with his own hand· 2. He introduces a men-
tion of his bonds, which he inserts by way of parenthesis.
3. He adds the salutation of his own hand, which he had

also in this place by salutation he understands that last
word, Grace be ‘202'thv you, as Theodoret, Chrysostom, and
Ambrose have rightly noted.

But before he subscribed that salutation, by a paren-
thesis as it were, on a sudden he introduces a mention of
his bonds: Remember, says he, my b072ds.] This perhaps
