Ver. 5. EP18TLE To THE conossmns. 43

those whom she was to conceive by the prophet, they also
were called children of fornication3 because following the
example of their mother they would most likely become
fornicators. Lastly, whichever of these be the fact, it
may be answered, That God can specially command a
thing which may be forbidden by the ordinary law: thus
he commanded Abraham to slay his innocent son, and the
Jews to carry away the goods of the Egyptians: There-
fore, by the intervention of a special and extraordinary
command, the obligation of an ordinary one ceases3 be-
cause the condition of the case is changed.

4. They object, Fornication is not contrary to charity;
therefore it is not a sin. For thus these points are argued
by Augustine, Tom. 9, De decem chord. cap. 10, When I
go to a harlot, to whom do I do what I am unwilling to sns-
fer? How do Ι violate that macrim, What you would not have
done to you, you should not do to another ? If I lust after
my neighbour's wife, I am unwilling that any one should last
after mine. If Ι covet my neiglzbour's goods, Ι am unwilling
that he should take away mine : I do therefore what I am un-
willing to suffer. Bac when I go to an lzarlot, to whom do I
do what I am unwilling to snffer?

I reply, it is repugnant to charity even in the highest
degree. 1. Inasmuch as it is repugnant to the good of the
offspring that may be born, whose instruction and educa-
tionis neglected‚ seeing that it is the conception of pro—
miscuous concubinage. 2. Inasmuch as it is repugnant to
the good of the woman who is corrupted, and to the good
of the fornicator himself3 whilst the body and mind in
each is polluted, and a deadly guilt is incurred. 3. Inas-
much as it is repugnant to the Divine love3 whilst the
image of God is destroyed by this foul lust, and the com-
mand of God is violated. Neither does it help them to
affirm that that mle, What yon wish not to be done to yon,
yon should not do to another, is not violated by fornication.
For what a man would wish to be done to by others is not
to be regarded simply : but what he would wish in a regu-
lated and sound will. If a man should wish his own

daughter to be defloured‚ it will not, therefore, be lawful
