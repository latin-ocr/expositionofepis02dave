Therefore the death of Christ was specially intended and

destined to bruise Satan under the feet of the elect, and

effectually to save them, and that according to the most
sure promise of God himself. A promise not dissimilar of
God the Father concerning the efficacy of the death of
Christ as to the elect, is contained in Isaiah liii. 10, ll.
The words are these, When tlzou shall make his soul ανι offier·
ing sor sin, he slzacl see his seed, he slwllprolong his dcrys, and

words God the Fathtr promises to the Son, that his pas-,
sion and death should not be useless or without fruit, but
a seed should undoubtedly be brought fort-h to him. I ask
then, whether this promise regards vague and uncertain

Lorrain, in which he distinguished himself by his ability and zeal in defence
of the Protestant cause. In the following year the civil wars broke out in
France; and, Rouen being taken, Montmorency‚ Constable of France,
threw Marlorat into prison, on the false charge of being a seducer of the
people. On this charge, of which No proofs were brought, he was condemned
to be hanged, his head then to be set upon a pole on the bridge of the city,
and his property confiscated. He accordingly suffered Oct. 30, 1562, in the
56th year of his age. He wrote Commentaries on Genesis, Job, the book
of Psalms, and the Song of Solomon‚ and on the prophecies of Isaialu and
abook of Common Places. But his greatest work is entitled‚ Novi Testa-
menti Catholica Expositio Ecclesiastico, of which there were not fewer than
uine Editions between the years 1561 and 1604. It was formerly held in
the highest estimatiom and deservedly so: it contains Erasmus's Latin
Version of the New Testament‚ and the Expositions are collected with sin-
gular industry and ability from the works of the early Ecclesiastical writers
as well as from modern Protestant Interpreters and Commentators, with
which the Author lias interwoven his own judicious remarks. English
translations of his Exposition of the Psalms and os the Gospels of St. Mat-
thew, Mark, and Luke‚ and of the Epistle of Jude‚ and the Apocalypse‚
were published at London during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. (Chac-
