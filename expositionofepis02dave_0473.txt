willing that those things which flow to men in the way of
grace, should be as common to all as those things which
are derived to men in the way of nature. He willed that
his grace should make men differ from each other, and
therefore he would not make it equally common to all men.
Augustine has noticed this (De Praedest. Sanct. cap. 5),
which consult at your leisure. Let no one then murmur
against God, because by the operation of his special grace
he regenerates some, and unites them to Christ by faith3
let no one enquire why he delivers one man rather than
another: since this answer of God himself is sufficient to
stop the mouth of any, (Mart. xx. 15) Is z'c not lawfulfor
me to do what Ι will with mine own? διο. And that of the

those who assert that the elect are, by the efficacy of the
death of Christ, justified and reconciled to God from
eternity.

OBJECTION 1. Those who assert that God is only
placable and reconcileable to the elect, and not actually
reconciled and pacified before their faith and repentance,
seem- to place acts and powers in God, and to admit that
God can be what he is not: But God is a pure act and al-
together immutable: 'l'here‘fore it is impossible that he
should now be what he was not before : If then he is re-
conciled to Peter or Paul, after they are known to repent
and believe, he was also reconciled to them from eternity.
For it may seem to be granted of itself, that any change in
God, who is a most pure act, and in every way most sim-
ple, is a variation. But that this is most foreign from the
