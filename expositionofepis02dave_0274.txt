264 AN EXPOSlTlON OF ST. PAUL'S Claap. iv.

commodated also to the edification and various advantages
of the brethren. This Paul extolled in the Corinthians,

(mee, in knowledge, &c.

3. They are deservedly to be blamed, who do not apply
themselves to sacred learning, which alone is wont to im-
bue the minds of rnen with this art of speaking wisely.
For that salt is hidden in the word: and thence 311 wisdom
is to be derived, which may be salutary either to the pos-
sessor himself, or to others. Hence the Apostles, being
instructed in the Divine word, are called lee Salt of the
earth, Matt. v. 13. In which form of speaking, that which
is the property of the Divine &Vord, is transferred to the
persons to whom the administration of it is committed.

4. We may hence infer the cause, why almost all
places every where echo with silly and insipid discourses3
namely, because most men are destitute of this salt of the
doctrine of the gospel, and of spiritual vvisdom, whence
every well seasoned speech flows.

5. Hence you will perceive with how great wickedness
the Romanists surround themselves, who take away the
salt of the Divine word from the people : for by that same
act they impose upon themselves the necessity as it were
both of thinking and speaking foofishly, to whom God
gives it in command both to acquire knowledge and
speech seasoned with salt to promote the advantage of their
neighbours. But to those to whom either the health or the
utility of their brethren is a matter of care, it behoves
them to season both their mind and their speech with the
salt of the Divine word: for every one is bound to know
that, says Gerson, part. 2. in Regul. moral„ without tlze
knowledge <ff wlciclz he cannotfulfill the command, (md avoid
sin.

And thus we have dispatched the three-sold apostolical
exhortation. Now we must pass on from the exhortations
to the second part of this Chapter, namely, to the Apos-
tolic encomiums and commendations which he bestows
upon certain distinguished men.
