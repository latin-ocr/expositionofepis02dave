Ver-,2 EPISTLE το THE cotossmus. 227

It is not my intention here to shew how often every day.
or at what hours we should pray: but we must shew that
we ought to be occupied very often, yea, very frequently,
in this exercise. As to the point of time, it is fit that we
eonsult⁶the spirit and the occasion.

Inducements for the frequency of the exercise of'
prayer.

1. Our prayer ought to be constant3 l. Because we
have constant and infinite causes for prayer. For what-
ever good we have, or desire to have; whatever evil we
either suffer, or deserve to suffer, or fear3 all these things
supply matter for prayer. The blessings which we have
excite to prayer; because in this manner God is to be ho-
noured on account of the benefits received: the blessings .
which we want stir up to prayer3 because they are to be
looked for from God alone. The evils which we suffer call
to prayer; because they can be removed by God alone:
the evils which we fear3 because by Him alone can they
be banished. Hence the holy Fathers named prayer, tlte
sacrifice of tlze Christian, tlze lrey of heaven, tlte supply of
want, the scourge (f tlze det-il, Sec. We have an example of
the constancy of prayer in Eusebius, lib.2. cap. 23.

2. Because constancy and importunity is the most effi-
cacious means of obtaining what we seek3 as Christ has
taught us in that parable, Luke xviii. 3 and has also shewn
in his own dealing towards the Canaanitish woman impor-
tunately beseeching him, and urging her prayers again and
again, Matt. xv. Hence Gregory, in Psal. vi. Poenitent.
sayS, God would be asked, would be compellesL would be cou-
quered as z't were by importunity : tlzis violence is good, where-
willz God z's not qffendecl, but placated.

3. Because this perseverance in prayer greatly contri-
butes to the declaring, increasing, and strengthening our
faith. For it is the property of a proud and disdainful pe-
titioner‚ to suffer no delayS, aud immediately to draw back
from prayer on account of any adjournment. Hence that
speech, 2 Kings vi. 33, What should 1 'evaitfor tlze Lord any
longer? But on the other hand, David, in Psal. v. 3, sayS, In
tlze morning will I direct my praefer nmo tleee aad will look up.
