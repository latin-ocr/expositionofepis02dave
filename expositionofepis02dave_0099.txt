Ver. 10. Epls'rLE To THE coLossmNs. 89

To this Ambrose seems to me to have alluded in those
words, Hexam. 6, cap. 8, leouart painted, O man, painled
by tlte Lord thy God ; tlzou least a good artist, and painter ,-
do not thou deface α good picture, slzinz'ng not witlz varnish, but
trutlz ; ‘not formed (ff wax, but (ff grace. He, therefore,
places the image of God which we bear in the effects of
grace. Then we are renewed after the image of God when
all the powers and inclinations of our souls are enlightened
and sanctified.

We derive these Instructions ε

l. The end of our regeneration is, that we may be
made like to God, and, like a hard and polished mirror,
reflect (as far as infirmity permits) his wisdom, righteous-
ness, hohness, &c.

2. Those who do not seek after holiness and righteous— ⁴
ness, still bear the image of the old Adam, nay, indeed,
that of the devil; they are not yet renewed after the image
of God, which chiefly consists in holiness: they must be
adjudged to him whose character they bear impressed on
their minds.

3. God’s kindness and love to man, must be considered
in this work of regeneration: it is a great proof of his
goodness and clemency‚ that he once willed that his image
should be impressed upon us3 and would renew and re-
store it again after it was obliterated and deformed. The
consideration of the value God set upon this restoration
will still more shew forth the Divine clemency : He created
man first in his image by his voice and his word3 but he
restored him a second time by his death and blood. Let,
then, this benevolence of God in regenerating us at so
great a cost, and renewing us after his image by his Holy
spirit, be a spur to us in laying aside our vices, and pur-
suing godliness.

So far of the twofold reasoning by which the Apostle
confirms the preceding dissuasions from vice z in the next
verse we have an amplification of the same reasoning.
