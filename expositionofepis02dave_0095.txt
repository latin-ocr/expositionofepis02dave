Ver. 10. EPISTLE To THE comssmns. 85

the renewing‚ and fresh propensity of all our faculties to
do good, infused into and impressed upon the faithful by
the power of the Holy spirit. I deliglzt in the law os God
qfter the inner man, Rom. vii. 22. T hat lze would grant *you
to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the imzer man,
Ephes. iii. 16. The Holy Spirit, therefore, strengthens the
renewed for those actions for which they before had neither
the faculty nor inclination. Two Corollaries arise out of
the consideration of this new man :

1. First, it excites to duty. It behoves those who have
put on the new man, to adopt a new method of life. If
any man be in Christ, he is a new creature ; old things are
passed away ,· behold, all things are become new .· 2 Cor. v. 17.
He who assumes the character of a king, isboth foolish⁴
and wicked if he acts the part of a buffoon3 so is it with
him who puts on the new man, if he shall act the part of

nothing is ours. What lzast thou wlziclz thou least not received?
l Cor. iv. 7. ”

2. Which is renewed] This word respects the manner,
sor it indicates the constant workings of the Holy spirit
in renewing us: as if he had said, This your renewing
ceases not for one moment3 for you have so put on the
new man, that ye be more aud more to be renewed daily:
which is clearly taught in 2 Cor. iv. 16, Bac though, our out-
ward mem perislz, yet tlze inward man is renewed day hy day.

Now the reason why there is need of this daily renewing
is on account of the remains of indwelling sin; which the
Divine wisdom has not seen fit to eradicate in a moment,
but would rather leave it to the day of our dissolution, for
the exercise of our virtue and the preservation of humility
within us. As, therefore, in wine mingled with water,
both wine and water are found in every part: so in the re-
newed man the conditions of regeneration and some cora
ruptions of the old man are found mingled and wound up
