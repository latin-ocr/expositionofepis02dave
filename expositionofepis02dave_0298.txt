conciliate love for him, For all love (as the Schools express

it) is founded in some communication or participation of
the same thing: therefore, they who are participants of the
same country and city, are united together as by a certain
closer hond of love. For as their native soil is used to be
dear to all, so it renders all things which spring from it
