pus to be admonished carefully to weigh the following
three things.

1θ What he had received3 the mim'slry] i. e. The Gos-
pel ministry‚ than which nothing is more sublime, nothing
more useful ; and therefore there is nothing to be handled
more faithfully and diligently. So the whole company of
the Apostles judged‚ Acts vi. 4, We will give ourselves con-
tinually to prayer and to tlze ministry of tlze word.

2. From whom he had received this ministry3 In the
Lord] i. e. by tlze Lord, as the Greek Scholia expound it.
Therefore by the authority of Christ, who called him to
this office, he would have this Archippus to be excited to
discharge it diligently and faithfully. For if Christ him-
self laid this office upon ministers, doubtless he will both
look for and require an account of the administration of
the office from them. Woe is unlo me, says the Apostle,
l Cor. ix. 16, 17, ff I preaclz mit tlze Gospel! For if I do
this thing williugly, l have α reward ; but z] against my· will,
α dispensatiore o] tlze Gospel is entruslecl to me.

3. For what end he had received this ministry3 leat
he migletfiiffil ia] This, therefore, ought always to be the
care of ministers‚ not so much to obtain honour, as to
execute the labour of the ministry 3 not so much that he
might be dignifiecl with that honourable office, as that he
might fulfil its duties. So Paul also admonished his
son Timothy, 2 Tim. iv. 5, Do the work (ff cm Erangelist,
malcefztll proof of thy ministry. But what is it lofulfil tlze
ministry? It is to do all those things which devolve upon
a minister, and which conduce to the salvation of meu and
the furtherance of the kingdom of Christ. Of this kind
are all those things which are enumerated by the Apostle
in the same Chapter [to Timothy], Preacli tlte word, be iu-
stant in sectson, tut eff seersum reprore, remisse, exhort, and
the like. These are the things about which Archippus was
to he admonished.

Hence observe, It is necessary for the minister who de-
sires rightly to discharge his duty, often and seriously to
consider, what ministry he has received, by whom it was
imposed and committed to him, and lastly, what end
Christ had in entrusting him with it.
