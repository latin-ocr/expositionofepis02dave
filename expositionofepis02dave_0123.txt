Ver. 13. Episrtn To THE οοιοεειΑΝε. 1113

nitely, and are therefore to be received universally, in this
man11er3 If any man, that is, whoever in truth he may be, w
whether superior or inferior: shall have α ᾳιιαννεῖ, that is, „ —
any cause of complaint whatever, on account of any
wrong done either in word or deed z against any, viz. whe- w
ther friend or foe3 let him know that the duty of forbear-
ing and fot-giving is necessarily imposed upon him.

l. If ajust cause is not a sufficient ground for inflict-
ing revenge, it is evident that they grievously offend who
break forth into disputes and strifes for trifling and nuga-
tory causes, nay, for those that are unjust and absolutely
nothing. See Matt. xviii. 28.

2. Since the act of forbearing and forgiving is required
from all towards all, the pride of the great and the rich is re-
buked‚ who think themselves exempt from this duty : as if
only the poor and weak were born to bear injuries, and· the
powerful and noble to inflict them. But the Scripture has
not respect for nobility, power, or riches, but for frater-
nity‚ when it speaks of the forgiveness of injuries. See
Matt. xviii. 21.

Itis asked, If this duty of forbearing and forgiving be>
so necessary to a Christian, that it is not lawful for him in
any way to repel an injury done to him, or to restrain or
punish the person who offers it; but is bound when he is
smitten on one clzeelc to turn the otl1er; or when leis cloalc is
taken away to offer his coac also? as Christ says, Matt. v.
39, 40.

We reply, That it is not by any means lawful for a pri-
vate. person by himself, and according to the dictates of
his own will, to seek his own revenge3 but it is sometimes
lawful to do it by means of the magistrate and according
to hisjudgment. Neither ought we to seek our revenge*
through the magistrate himself with an exasperatae] and
corrupt mind, that is, with the passion of anger and hatred
against our neighbour3 but with a peaceful and meek mind,
that is, from a zeal for righteousness, and a desire for the
amendment of our neighbour: for it is better to lose any
thing of this world, than to make a wreck of our patience
