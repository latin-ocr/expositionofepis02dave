Ver. 10. nrisTLss 'ro THE corossmss. 279

to salute others, or to answer those saluting him, 2 Kings
iv. 29. Christ himself also, when he sent his disciples to
preach, said, Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes; and
salute ηο man hy the way, Luke x. 4. If it be frivolous to
salute⁶those whom we meet with words, then it will also be.
frivolous to salute absent persons by letters.

We answer, that these phrases are tropes and hyper-
boles; and that the force ofthe words is this, to forbid us
to contrive by the way, or to do any thing which may re-
tard the business we have undertaken. Both, therefore,
would mean, that we must even abst-ain from salutations‚
if perchance they might hinder the execution of the office
consigned to us· , but absolutely to forbid these duties of
humanity, was not either the mind of the prophet, or of
the Saviour, in the wmds cited. Hence observe,

l. That external duties of humanity‚ which make for
the increase of charity, are diligently to be performed by
pious men. Hence Augustine blamed the inhumanity of
those who neglected these things: [f any one slzou!d noc
salute lzim whom lze may meet, lle will not be accouuted a man
by che mavellem buta post, or a statue of Mer-cury. Serm-
42. de sanctis.

2. That they are to be performed not only in confor-
mity with mere custom‚ but from love and true charity.
For he incurs the guilt of a hypocrite and liar, who salutes
him by word to whom from his soul he wishes not health
and prosperity. So Judas saluted Christ, whom he went
about to kill, Hail, Master! Matt. xxvi. 49.

3. That they sin, who would have this duty of Chris-
tian charity to serve their pride and ambition. So the
Pharisees of old, whom on this account the Savionr re-
bukes, because theg] loved salutations in the market places:
so the great ones amo-ng the heaffien, who exacted this
from their dependents. Hence the poet (Mart. lib. 3, epig.
36) complains of Fabian3 he commands (says lie) more
than what is just,

Horridus uc primo semper te mam} salutem,
Per mediumque trahil me lua sella latum.
