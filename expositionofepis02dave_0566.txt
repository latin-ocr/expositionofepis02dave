secret intention, hath taken care that the merit of the
death of Christ should be applied to some for the infallible
obtaining of saith and eternal life. Secondly‚ we say, That
it is not unjust or incongruous, that this special intention
of an effectual application of the merits of Christ should
exhibit its efficacy in some, and not in all men3 because,
since the death of Christ is a free gift of God bestowed
on the human race, the free distribution and application of
merits arising from it, ought by all means to depend on
the mere will of God. leirdhfi we add, That God, who
in the Gospel has promised eternal life to all men indivi-

is this inconsistency to be found? Not with respect to
those who believe and are saved3 for it is not culpable in—
justice to give, on account of the merits of Christ, to indi-

but it is laud-able goodness to do this. Not with respect
to those who believe not, and perish3 for it is not unjust
in itself, nor can it be judged to be inconsistent with the
supreme goodness of God, to deny that benefit to any one,
which it appears is not in any way due to him.

the evangelical covenant, according to the tenor of which
eternal life is due to every one that believeth, made no
division or separation of men, so that we can say that any
one is excluded from the benefit of his death, if he should
believe. And in this sense we contend, in agreement with
the Scriptures, the fathers, and solid arguments, that
Christ suffered on the cross and died for all men, or for the
whole human race. We add, moreover, that this Media-
tor, when he had determined to lay down his life for sin,
had also this special intention, that, by virtue of his
merits, he would effectually and infallibly quicken and
bring to eternal life, some persons who were specially
