116 AN EXPOSITION or sT. PAUL’s Clcap. iii.

xxiii. 34. Such was the perfect bearing of injuries and
the forgiveness of Christ, of which the Apostle speaks in
saying, As Christ has forgiven you, so also do με. We ought
therefore, to compare ourselves with this example3 and
although we cannot attain to its perfection, yet we should
remember always to propose to ourselves its imitation.

We derive the following instructions3

l. It behoves a Christian to be certain of the pardon of
his sins through Christ: since this pardoning is the rule
and measure of pardoning others3 but a rule ought to be
fixed and certain.

2. He who does not freely pardon others, never feels in
his heart the benefit of Christ pardoning his sins: neither
can he who has not resolved to forgive his neighbour, con·
clude that his own sins are forgiven of God.

3. In vain does the mind eager for revenge excuse its
own malice by the extent of the injury done, and by the
loss to the man's own character if revenge be neglected,
and other points of the like nature, by which nien are ac-
customed to inflame themselves with revenge. All these
considerations vanish if we attend to the rule laid down
by the Apossse, As Christ ΙιαίΙι forgiven you, so also do με.

4. It is, therefore, a diabolical opinion, which has pos-
sessed the minds of almost all those who lay claim to gen-
tility, that they cannot bear, even a reproachful word, with-
out the loss of their honour and their reputation ; but are
under the necessity of seeking revenge in a (luel, at the
manifest peril of their own lives, and a plain attack upon the
life of another.

This more than heathenish opinion can be refuted by

many arguments:
1. We pull down the very foundation of what we are

striving to build‚ by laying down this maxim. It is not a
sign of a cowardly or ignoble mind, nor disgraceful or
mean in a Christian, to bear injuries, but to inflict them.
This was briefly proved above, when we were reasoning on
ineekness, patience, and their acts : we will now add, that
this was even approved by the very heathens, especially the
wiser among them. Socrates, as we find in Plato (in his
