its own natural endowments, as that from thence God, ac-
cording to his ordinary law, dictated to himself of his own
goodness‚ may be bound to give spiritual grace to a natu-
ral man. But this is contrary to the Apossse, who says»,
(Rom. xi.. 6) grace is no more grace, ff it be of works. For,
as Fulgentius says, (De Incarn. & Grat. Christi, cap, 18)
We should not then receive it from tlte compassiou qf the Giver,
butfrom the equit-y of retribution. Secondly, It would fol-
low also, that the reason of predestination and preterition
is to be assigned to the different qualities or actions of
men, which all the orthodox oppose3 since the reason of
predestination, which is a preparation of grace, cannot be
different from the reason os grace, which is the bringing of
it into act. He, therefore, who teaches that the reason of
grace being given or not given, is to be sought from hu- '
man dispositions or operations, necessarily seeks for the
same reason of predestination and preterition. Thirdly‚,1t
would follow, that God would oppose a law made by him-
self, when he, as it were, forces grace upon those who
place an obstacle to his grace, which the Apostle Paul
most humbly confesses that he had done3 and yet God
mercifully called him to the knowledge and grace of
Christ, when he was committing a flagrant sin and rushing
against Christ. On which Fulgentius excellently observes
(De Incarn. δί Grat. cap. 18‚) In what tlze mercy of God pre·
‘cents ns, or preventing what things it finds in us, the Teuchei-
of the Gentiles skews us, not in any otker, but in himself, soy-
ing, Wno WAs BEroRE a blasphemer, &a Here he inti-
mateS, indeed, that all men are refractory until preventing
grace subdues them. Fourthly, If it be admitted, that
this giving or denying of grace, is according as human
wills place an obstacle in the way or not, almost all the
definitions in the Councils against the Pelagians will be set
aside, such as, first, the decree against Pelagius in the
Diospolitan Council,* It z‘s corffessecL tlzat grace is not given

¹* This Council was convened in the year 418, by two Bishops of Gaul,
Heros and Lazarus, who joined with Orosius, a Spanisli Priest of that pe-
riod, and drew up a Petition embodying the errors wherewith they charged
Pelagius, as contained in his books, and taught by Coelestinus his disciple-
