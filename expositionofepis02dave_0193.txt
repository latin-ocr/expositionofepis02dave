was commended by Gregory of Tours, is condemned, as
we have before shewn. But, in >order that it may be un-
derstood how inconsiderately he has extolled this and that,
we shall add what Bellarmin conceals from this same his-
tory, that Leobardus not only himself entered a monastery
against the will of his parents, but against his saith pledged
to a virtuous damsel to marry her3 and .Pappula herself,
not only unknown to and against the will of her parentS‚
but, moreover, assuming the habit of a man, entered the
monastery, and carried herself in it as a man for thirty
years. At the Couneil of Gangra, Cap. 13, an anathema
was pronounced against every woman on this very account
who should assume the male attireflss Away, therefore,
with the commendat-ion of Gregory, which isdiametrically
repugnant as well to the decree of a grave Council, as to'
the interdict of God himself.

* This Council of Gangra, in Paphlagonia, was held about the year 370.
It was assembled in reference to the errors of one Eustathius‚ but a differ-
ent person from the Bishop of Sebastea of that name. Under pretence of
leading a more perfect and austere life, he established such practices as were
considered contrary to the laws of the Church. His errors were condemned
in twenty Canons drawn up by this Council. which have been placed in the
Code of the Canons of the Universal (the Roman) Church. The conclud-
ing words of the Fathers of this Council are too remarkable not to be cited
here, and especially as worthy of observation in the present day. They are
thus given by Du Pin. “ We ordain these things not to conclude those
‘⁶ who would, according to the advices of Holy Scripture, exercise them-
“ selves in the Church by these practices of continence and piety, but
‘⁵ against those who use these kinds of austerities for a pretence to satisfy
“ their ambition, who despise those who lead an ordinary life, and who in-
“ troduce innovations contrary to Scripture and the ecclesiastica] Jaws. We
“ admire virginity when it is accompanied with humility; we praise absti-
“ nence which isjoined with piety and prudence3 we respect that retire-
“ ment which is made with humility; but we also honour marriage. We
“ do not blame-riches when they are in the hands of persons that are just
‘⁶ and >beneficent3 we esteem those who clothe themselves modestly, with-
“ out pride and affectation, and we abhor uncivil and voluptuous apparel:
“ We have a reverence for churehes, and we approve the assemblies which
“ are there made as holy and useful: we do not confine piety to houses. We
‘⁶ honour all places built to the name of God3 we approve the assemblies
⁴‘ which are kept in the Church for the public good. We praise the Lar-
“ gesses which the faithful give to the Church to be distributed among the
>⁶⁴ poor. In a word, we wish and desire that these things may be observed
