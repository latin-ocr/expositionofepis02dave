from their diverse objects: For one is called peruicious;
another, officious; and another, jocose. The first is em-
ployed for the sake of injury3 the second, for that of as-
sistance; the third, for diversion.

2. We shall inquire if any of these be lawful, and
without sin before God.

First, the Scripture itself denies it. Thus Revel. xxi. 8,
Fornicutors‚ mowers, and all Ιίανε, shall have their part in
the lake wlzz'clz burnetlz withfire and brz'mst‘one. And, xxii. 15,
Witlcout are dogs, and whosoever loveth and malcetlc a lie. In
Prov. xii. 22, Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord.
Ephes. iv. 25, leerefore puttz‘ng away lying, spealc every
man trutlz witlzlzis neighbour. Secondly, Right reason de-
nies it. For what is in itself evil in its nature, (ex genere)
can by no means be good and lawful : but every falsehood
is in itself evil, since it is an act grounded upon an un·-
lawful matter. Thus Durandus says, lib. 3. dist. 38. qu. Ι,
Lunguuge was instituted, not that men might deceive one
another by it, but that they should use it to tell their mutual
thoughts: it is therefore an unlawful uctfor one to ulter words
to signffy that which he dotlz not intend in lzis mind. Aquinas
proves this by the same reasoning, Q. 2. qu. 110, art. 3,
Language, says he, is lt‘ze natural sign of tlze undet-standing:
it is therefore umzatural and unlawful tlzut any one should
signisy tlzat (gy his speech which does not exist in his mind.
Hence Aristotle (Eth. 4. cap. 7) concludes that all false-
hood is wrong in itself, and to be avoided. Wherefore the
most sound of the Fathers held all falsehood to be sin.
Augustine, Enchirid. cap. 18, says, Every salsehood z's a
sin, although he cloes not sin so greatly who lies with the desire
of advising, as he does witlz tlzat (ff injuring. And again, in
his treatise De mendacio ad Cons. cap. 21, No one is to be
brought to everlasting salvation by the aid of a lie. Clemens
Alexandrinus, Strom. 7, says, A good man neither on lzz's own
account or his ozezssglzboaezr²s will lie. Gregory, Moral. 18, cap.
4, on Job xxvii. writes, Every fulsehood is sin : for whatever
is discordant witle truth, dz‘sagrees with equity. Neitlter is the
life of ang] one to be defended by thefullucy (ff lyzng, lest he
