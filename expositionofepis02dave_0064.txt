54 AN Exposv'rloN or ετ. ΡΑυιέ Chasp. iii.

The quality of the persons subjected to this Divine wrath:
the children of disobedience‚ ἐπὶ τους ὑιοὺς ‘tn‘ ς ἀπειθείας.

l. For which thz'ngs' sake] namely, for fornication, un-
cleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupisc-enee, and covetous-
ness, the wrath of God falleth upon sinners. These words
are not to be taken in such sense, that we should conclude
it is peculiar to these sins alone to excite the Divine wrath
(for this meets all sins) 3 but because upon those gross fla-
gitious crimes, which especially overthrow human happi-
ness, God is especially provoked to exercise vengeance.
And on this account, the chief argument is: These sins
are the occasion of heavier punishments3 therefore, from
them we must abstain with all care, for z't z's asemful thing
to sall into tlze hands of l‘lze living God, Heb. x. 31. The
Apostle wished to point out distinctly the cause of human
misery‚ and of the Divine judgments, for two reasons,

l. That God might be cleared from all suspicion of
cruelty or injustiee‚ and might be acknowledged by all
most merciful and just. For God is tlte Fatlzer· (ff menies,
and not willing to overwhelm the human race with such
calamities z but as the Poet formerly sang· :

At heaven itself we aim tlzrouglijblly ,-
And snclz our crimes e'en God we ⁵¹!ff6'7' not,

To lay aside his vetiges‘ul bolts.
Hor. lib. 1. od. 3.

Therefore our wickednesses provoke the Divine wrath
against us.

2. To throw a restraint upon the wicked ε For, as saith
Cyprian, it affords great power to tlze we'clced when he can (le-
liberately rushjbrward witlz impunity. On the other hand,
It hath great power in restraining sin, when he understands
it to be the sure cause of future misery. This the Apos-
tle intimates in these words, For which tlzz'ngs’ sake the
wratlz of God cometlz, διο. >

lee wrath (ff God] We pass from the cause to the ef-
fect. The Fathers with almost unanimous consent explain
the wrallc qf God to be the Divine punishment or ven-
geance. For it is not fit to assign troubled affections to
God 3 since, as Augustine hath truly said, in Evang. Joan,
