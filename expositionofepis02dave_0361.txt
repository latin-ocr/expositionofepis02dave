Chap. ii. As THE UNiVERsAL CAUSE or SALVAT‘loN. 351

The last testimony is deduced from those passages com-
bined, in which the will of Christ in dying is declared to
be of such extent as to be the procuring cause of salva-
tion to all. Of this description are, 2 Cor. v. 14, One died
Jor all. lTim. ii. 6, cho gave himself a ransom for all.
Heb. ii: 9, Tlmt he bys tlte grace of God should tasce death

for every man. And l John ii. 2, He is tlze propitiationfor
our sins, and notfor ομνε only, buc also sor tlze sins os tlze
whole world. I omit other texts. These and such like
passages, although the conclusion of some of the Remon-
strants cannot be inferred from them, namely, leat by tlzz's
death, qs Christ reconciliatz‘on and remission of sins were ac-
quir-ed or obtained for eaclz and every man: Or, That eaclz
and every man was restored into α state (ff grace and salvatz‘on
by the deatlz of Clu-isc itself: nevertheless they prove in a
manner sufficiently strong what we intend, That this death·
of Christ was appointed and ordaiued by God and Christ
for an universal cause of salvation, or an universal remedy
for all men, applicable to the obtaining of reconciliation
and remissiori. Ido not therefore see by what right or
what necessity some divines limit passages of this kind, in
which Christ is plainly affirmed to have szgffered for all, to
the elect alone, or to the whole body of the elect alone,
when in the aforesaid sense they may be most truly ex-
tended to all other persons. For nothing hinders but that
that may be applicable to all by some Divine appointment
which, from the predestination of God, is infallibly to be
applied only to the elect. For they grant that dogma of
the Remonstrants (Colloq. Hagiens. p. 139) leat Christ
died nocfor the elect alone, but also for other men, if it be
understood only qs the sufficz'eucy (ff tlte mer-its ‹ffClzrz'st ; but
if only of reconciliation effectually or actually produced,
they deny it. This is enough for me. For they will never
rightly defend the alone-sufficiency of the death of Christ
as to all, unless they confess at the same time that it is
applicable to all for salvation, according to the appoint-
ment of God. Since it is foolishly and falsely asserted,
that He died for all sufficiently, who is affirmed to have
died only for the elect; because the word sufficient& is not
