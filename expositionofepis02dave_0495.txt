sufficiently the means of salvation, it would seem not to
be equitable, that on account of the preaching of the
word, which was despised by their ancestors in the time of
Noah, he should deny it to their posterity after some thou-
sands of years. For if notwithstanding the sin of Adam,
it was obtained by the death of Christ (according to their
opinion) that sufficient means of salvation should be admi-
nistered to all, it would be unreasonable and unjust to
break this, as it were, ordinary law, on pretence of sins
committed by some others who were our ancestors. As,
therefore, on account of the sin of Adam, God may justly
deny to his posterity every spiritual benefit, so we admit
that from the sins of the ancestors of others, God may also
take occasion to deny to us any gratuitous benefit. Butif.
by the death of Christ and the concurring goodness of
God, a law is established concerning the administration of
the means of grace, now, as if on account of the sin* of
Adam, who was the federal head of all his posterity, God
will not abrogate this his decree3 so much less consistent
is it, that on account of the sins of others, who do not
sustain this common relationship to the human race, their
posterity should be deprived of this benefit. In vain,
therefore, do they resort to the sins of their ancestors, in
order to give a reason for the denial of this thing, who
profess, that by virtue of the death of Christ and the good-
ness of God, it was prepared for all men individually by
the Divine decree, and as it were due to them by an es-
tablished law.

OBJECTION 3. Thirdly‚ they answer, Thac tlze grace Qf
tlze Gospel is denies] to some, because by continued transgression
against tlte law they have shown themselves to be unworthy of
having Divine grace effer-ed to them.

REPLY. But this answer‘ will make the truth of our
opinion more evident. For, 111 the first place, Ι assume,
what no inan in his senses will deny, that every man in the
state of corrupt nature, if his sins were marked, has shewn
himself to be unworthy of the grace of the Gospel. And
Ι also add, That the worthiness and unworthiness of rnen,
or their greater and less unworthiness, is not the rule ac-
