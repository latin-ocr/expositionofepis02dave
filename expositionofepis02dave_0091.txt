Ver. 9. Epls'rLE 'ro Tm: commum& 81

He answers, first, that tlze enunciation. mentioned above is
notfalse, because the enunciation or proposition, wln'clzz's partly
expresses] and partly concez'ved in tlze mind, is one: bat that is
true, viz. 1 am not apriest of Apollo, or I am not α priest
obliged to det-lare it.

Iu reply; we allow this proposition, I am not a priesc
obliged to declar-e tlzat I am one, is one: but we affirm that
that other also which is expressed in words is an entire
proposition, and distinct from this. Therefooe, by this
very point in which he defends himself, he is convicted of
alie3 namely, that when he conceives the true proposi-
tion in his mind, he utters a falsehood: for although the
true and false one may be in the view of the internal con-
ception of the mind ς yet the lie properly so called, regards
the other, and the external declaration of the mind by the⁴
signs of words. However true, therefore, may be that
which this priest has shut up in the conception of his
mind, yet what he puts forth by the enunciation of a false
proposition is a lie.

We may illustrate this by an example. Suppose any one
being asked, Whether fire is hot, should assert and swear
that fire is not hot, this distinction being reserved in his
mind, that it is not hot by adventitious heat3 or should
any one say that man is not a rational animal, and then
should defend himself on the ground that he is not a ra-
tional animal of the feathered 01· finny tribe; who would

Parsons lived under the several appellations of WValley, Darcy, Roberts,
Farmer, and Phillips. Weu might he contend for the principles combated
by our Expositor. Thus, while Garnet and others of his fraternity became
the victims of their zeal, he kept himself secure from danger, and died in
1610, at Rome, where he had for twenty-three years presided over the
English College. Besides his Tract above-mentioned in defence of lying,
he was the author of a “ Conference about the Succession to the Crown of
England‚” which he published under the name of Doleman, with a Dedica-
tion to the Earl of Essexg with other Tracts adapted to promote the un-
ceasing designs of the Papal agents of his Order against Protestantism. He
devoted one entire Pamphlet to the Defamation of the Earl of Leicester‚ an
edition of which was published on the Continent, with a most mischievous
and appalling title. Vide Sharon Turner's Modern History-Reign of
Elizabeth, Notes.
