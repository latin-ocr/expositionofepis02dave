shall have shewn themselves more than servants3 equalz'ty
requires that their masters by liberality and munificence
should shew themselves more than masters. Let thy soul
love a good servant ,· desi-aud him not of liberty, neither leave
lzim to ivam, Eccles. vii. 21.
Instructions:
From the fact, that even masters are subject
to rule.

1. A prudent dispenser of the word ought to instruct,
admonish, and reprove, not only servants, or subjectS, or
men of the lowest rank3 but masters, magistrates, and
likewise those who have submitted themselves to the yoke
of Christ.

2. However it is usual for superiors to complain of the
vices of their subjects (and that justly 3) yet for the most⁴
part they are tainted with no less faults ε it is incumbent
therefore upon both not so much to exaggerate the faults
of another, as each to reform his own.

From that precept of giving servants what isjust:

1. He is an unjust and wicked master who treats his
servants after his own mle, not that of the Divine will:
for the will of God is the rule of justice, and always pre-
scribes a golden medium3 the human will verges to ex-
tremes. Hence said Plato, epist. 9, A moderate service is
wlzat pleases God ; cm immoderate one what is required by the
cupidz'ty of φηαηῇὲ

³⁸⁶ Had our Expositor lived in the present day, we should in all proba-
bility have had some suitable illustration and admonitions on a point which
he lias not treated: for what topic of interest and importance connected
with the subject in hand, or growing naturally out of his text, has he not
discussed? But the condition of slaves was not known in his time, nor, as
it has since existed, could have been foreseen. The violation of human li-
berty in injured Africa, and the horrors ofa middle passage had not been disco-
vered. The system which he has but touched had not been fully developed:
the sound of the slave-whip—the details of shooting excursions-the
moanings of separated parents and children, husbands and wives—and the
shrieks and groans of mutilated innocence and female torture, had not been
heard on this side of the Atlantic. The exclusion of Missionary efforts and
Religion from those dragged from their homes, and with nought besides to
comfort them, had not been reported in England; and a thousand other

abominationis contrary to Clnistian picty, practised upon ilic ui1‹,›ffendin;1
