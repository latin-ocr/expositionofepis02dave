treated who conduct the spiritual kingdom under Christ,
the spiritual King.

3. Nothing can be more miserable or more mad than
the enemies of the Gospel ε because they oppose the king-
dom of God itself, which they cannot overcome3 and, as
if they endeavoured to establish the kingdom of Satan,
which will be overturned, together with all the favourers
of it.

Which. have been a comfort unio ‘med' Παρηγορειν, signifies
either to exhort, or to comfort. The Apostle therefore inti-
mates, that these three men in each respect, as well in the
work of exhorting, as of comforting, proved themselves
constant fellow-helpers : They exhorted him to endure the
cross patiently3 they comforted him by visiting him, by
condoling with him, by ministering to his necessities;
finally, they omitted nothing which could smooth or miti-
gate that miserable condition of Paul now in prison.

Instructions.

l. The wisest and the best of men under the cross need
the exhortations and consolations of the godly. This the
royal Prophet confesses, and in Ps. lxix. 20, bitterly com-
plains that all had failed in this duty to him3 I loolced for
some co take Pity, but there was noue ,· amlfor comforterS, but
I found none.

2. It is a singular mark of the godly and truly faithful,
to assist the afflicted, both by word and deed, and thus by
the diligent employ of every duty, to refresh and comfort
thern. Thus Paul describes true saints3 Distributittg to tlte
necessity cf saints ; quoz'cing witlz them that do rqjoz'ce, weep-
ing wiell them that weep, διο. Rom. xii. 13, 15.

3. They, therefore, have nothing of Christian charity in
them, who regard not the miseries and griefs of others, so
that they themselves enjoy ease and pleasure. Of this sort
were those at whom Amos directs his most pungent re-
proof, vi. 4, &c. Ye lie upon becls of ivor-y, and stretclzyour-
selues upon your couches, &c- but ye are not grieved jor tlte
qffliction of Joseplz.
