<ff cmffusion, but of peace, l Cor. xiV. 33, They, therefore,
are repugnant to God, who would take away the order of
obeyiug and ruling.

2. It is not the mark of a base and abjeet mind, but of
a generous one, and one not deviating from the law of
creation, to be subject promptly and with a willing mind to
his superiors. Whence that. saying of the Heafflen, The
governwent over tlte good is easy ; every man in proportion to
his depracity bears α ruler witlz a rude impatz'ence.

3. They who shake off the yoke of due subjection‚ are ⁴
blind to their own interest: for that old adage is true,
πειθαρχία ἐς-ἱ τοιῗ ς gammam μητηρ, obedience is the mother· qs
prosperity.

But we must no longer eleave to generals: let us come
to the particular subjection of wives. This, then, we say
consists in three things ε

First, in the internal act of the heart3 when the wife
acknowledges in her mind, that her husband is and ought
to be her head and governor, and that she is the inferior,
even on the mere ground that she is a wife, although in
birth, riches, virtue, and prudence, she excel her husband.
This submission of the beart is the fountain of outward
subjection 3 without this, all subjection is either forced or
pretended. The Apostle seems to have had respect to this
inward disposition in Ephes. v. 33, Lec the wife reverence
lter husband. That pious Sarah possessed this is evident,
who called Abraham her husband lord, not from the flat-
tery of custom, but from th'e wish of testifying this sub-
jection‚ l Pet. iii. 6.

Secondly, this subjection of the wife consists in the
study of conformiug her manners and affections‚ as much
as possible, to the manners and affections of her husband
in things indifferent and lawful : For tlte dissimilitude (sman-
ηεγε kas no tendenqy to love, says Aristotle, Oeconom. lib. i.
