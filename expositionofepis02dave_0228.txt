not be 111 forces-Le! my will standfor a reason ; but let the
master be ready to hearken to them and yield‚ as often as
reason and truth shall require it. Job'professes that he
had rendered this equity to 1115 servants3 and, unless he
had done 50, would have been obnoxious to the Divine

anger: If J did despise the cause ‹ffmy man-servant or (gf ‘my
