224 AN ExeosvrloN OF ST. PA‘UL’s Chap. iv.

Vers. 2, &c-

continue z'n pra-yet· (or, apply with all earnestness) and
watch in tlte same wz'clz thanlcsgiving, διο.

In this verse and the two following, he stirs up the Co-
lossians to that most divine and useful work ofprayer. In
treating which, it is not my intention to explain this trite
subject of prayer3 but only to expound those things which

Three conditions are enumerated in this place:

Earnest perseverance,
Cautious watchfulness,
Pious gratitude :

continue in prayer, Tm* wpoceuxn προσκαρτερεῖτε] This
Greek word is derived from κάρτος, which with one letter
transposed is the same as κράτος, that is, strength, earnest-

strenuously to persevere, and προσκαρτερειν, to apply with ar-
dour and assiduity to any difficult and laborious thing,
until you shall have brought it to the wished-for end, and
shall have obtained the victory, as it were. Προσκοιρτερησις,
therefore, involves these two things : a certain earnest in-
tention of mind, and as it were struggle, whilst occupied
in prayer3 and an assiduous frequenoy in prayer: with all
prayer ancl supplicatim in tlze Spiris, Ephes. vi. 18.

As to this earnestness‚ or intention of mind ; it is indeed
very necessary on many accounts:

1. Because the occasions for prayer of this kind are
such as ought greatly to excite the human mind to perform
