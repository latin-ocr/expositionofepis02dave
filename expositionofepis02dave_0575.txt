mon order of Providence. In this sense he willed and iii-⁶
tended the obedience and salvation of the angels who apos-

tatised, inasmuch as he furnished them with gifts, fit in(
themselves and suitable‚ to perform obedience and obtain

salvation. And in this sense God, with a general inten-

tion, wills life to all men, inasmuch as he willed the death

of Christ to be the fountain and cause of life to all men

individually, according to the tenor of the evangelical co-

venant. But we must observe, that the Scriptures men-

tion another will or intention of God, and that properly so

called, which never fails in producing the good intended,

and which the Schoolmen refer to the order of special pre-

destination. Of this intention or will of God, Augustine

rightly says from the Psalmist, (Ench. cap. 97) In heaven*
and in earth there are some things which God did not both will
and perform: there are some things which he willed and, did
not perform, though he hath done all things whatsoever he
would. And Aquinas, (l. qu. 10, art. 6.) Whatever God
simply wills, he performs. If, therefore, by this general
intention of God to procure the salvation of all men by
the death of Christ, they wish to exclude the special will,
and special and effectual operation of God in effecting the
salvation of the elect3 or if they would infer from thence,
That the benefit of the death of Christ, that is, the grace
of God and eternal salvation of men (as far as relates to
God) is intended for all men individually with the same
kind of will, and is applied by the same mode of opera-
tion, really and actually to be had and obtained by each

individual, according as he makes a good use of his own

free-wi113 they bring forward Semipelagianism. But if by

this general intention they mean nothing more than a

general aptitude and sufficiency in the death of Christ to

effect the salvation of all men individually in the mode of
an universal cause, or a general appointment of God

concerning the salvation of all men individually, who,

through the grace of God, duly apply to themselves this

universal cause; then there is no need to reject this form

of speaking.
