to seek the aid of the magistrate against those who do us
injury is evident hence3 1. Because God himself, who ap-
proves nothing contrary to charity, hath ordained magis-
trates and tribunals. 2. Because laws in all well organised
states are enacted for the repairing of injuries; which laws

as far as the preparation of the mind is concerned3 and they
are to be followed in the outward acc, as often as the glory
of God and the good of our neighbour requires. See more
on this point in Augustine, Epist. 5, ad Marcellinum.
Even as Christ forgave yson, so also do yffi] Supply the
wordforgive. The example of Christ ought to have with
Christians both the force of an argument for persuasion
and of a rule for directim, as far as forbearing and forgiv-
ing are concerned3 the force of an argument3 because the
members ought to correspond to their head. A proud or a
feeble member is inconsistent with a head which is humble
