But is any one should still urge, Why is the death of
Christ declared to be given sor a remedy to all men, but
saith is not said to be given or prepared sor all ‘3 Ι answer,
Because the Scriptures clearly teach, that Christ by dying
obtained sor each and every man this grace, that, under the
condition of saith, they might now hope sor and obtain re-
mission of sins and salvation: but this conditional grace
could not be offered to all, nor could regard all in every
way, unless this death os Christ should pertain to all men
from the ordination os God himself. Now, on the other
hand, we do not maintain that saith is destined sor or given
to all, because the same holy Scripture, which proposes
the death os Christ as a benefit vouchsafed to all and ap-
plicable to every one through saith, does not make this
saith a benefit promised or given to all, but derived from
the peculiar decree os election. In addition to these '
things, the Mediator himself, who offered himself sor a
sacrifice to God to expiate the sins os the world, (Acts iii.
19 et seq.) obtained from God that all those individuals
who should believe in him, should be absolved from their
sins, and so far was willing to pay this ransom sor all: but
he did not apply to all the merit of his death, nor obtained
from God that all should infallibly partake os saith and
salvation. And here the secret os electiori discovers itsels,
which ought not to overturn or weaken the universality of
the oblation‚ or the truth of the promise of the Gospel.
OBJEchoN 10. Is the death of Christ were to be con-
ceived by us as a remedy applicable to all men, then the
holy Scriptures would not restrain the actual giving of the
Son to those only who believe; but they apply to the saith-
sul alone not only the benefit or real application, but also
the very gift of the Son, John iii. 15, God so loved tlze world,
that he gave his only begotten Son, that wlzosoever believetlz in
kim should not perish, but have eternal lg'fe. That which is
given to mankind conditionally‚ is understood to be given
to no one, is the condition be set aside. Since, therefore,
this condition os believing is fulfilled by the elect alone,
the consequence is, that we should say, that Christ was of-
