Zuingle, accompanying him to Berne, to the disputations held there in
1528. His friend falling in the battle fought between the Catholic and Pro-

defended in 1545 the tenets ofhis brethren against the censores of Loth-er,
resisting at the same time the attempts of Bucer to bring about a compro-
mise between the two sects respecting the eucharist. He also distinguished
himself by the effectual resistance which he made against the proposed
treaty, by which a number of Swiss mercenaries were to be taken into the
service of France, on the ground that it was inconsistent with Christianity
for any one to let himself out for the purpose of killing those who had
never injured him. He died at Zurich in 1575, leaving behind him ten
volumes of printed controversial treatises, with several manuscript pieces.
