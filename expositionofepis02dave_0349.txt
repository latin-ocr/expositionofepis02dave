sor one norton, butfor the whole world. A little afterwards :

That reprobate and deplorably wiclced men do not receive it, z's
not through any defece in the grace of God, nor is it just that
on account of the children of perdition, it should lose the glory
ond title of universal redemption, since it is prepared for all,
and assare called to it. To all these may be added Zan-
chiusj’t who so defends predestination‚ that at the same
time he contends that Christ died for all. For when he
had taught that Christ had not died for all, as it regards
the omnipoteni· will of God, that is, his absolute good plens-ure
of cotferring eternol life on all mankind, through the death
of Christ, yet he snbjoins, That it is not false that Christ
diedfor all men os it regards his conditional will, that is, ²f
they ore willing to become portalrers of his death through saith.
For the death of Christ is set before all in the G'ospel, and no
one is excluded from it, but he who excludes himseff. (MisceL'
de Praed. Sanctor. Explic. Thes. 13.) That I may not be
tiresome, Ι omit the rest. This is one thingl should wish
to be observed, That our orthodox Doctors so explained
the doctrines of election and reprobation, that the decree
concerning the chusing of certain individual persons to
the infallible obtaining of eternal life, and passing by
others, might not infringe the universality of the redemp-
tion accomplished by the death of Christ.

Hitherto we have briefiy surveyed those things which
relate to the historical knowledge of this controversy.
From which it is manifest, not only that the antient
Famem, but also our modern Divines, confessed that the
death of Christ pertained in some manner to the whole
human race. Yet in our age it has pleased some Divines
to pass over these limits, and openly to defend in exclu-
sive terms this proposition, That Christ died for the elect
alone. To whom on the opposite side others reply, Thac
Christ ‹fflred himseff lo God the Fother to redeem all indivi-
duals equally, That we may throw some light upon this
question, we will now enter upon that twofold considera-
tion of the death of Christ of which we have before made
mention, and will reduce it to certain propositions.
