As to the private reading of the Scriptures: Jemme, ad
Denietriad. de virginit. servanda ; Chrysostom, Hom. 1, and
2 111 Matt. and Hom. 3, de Lazaro, and Hom. 9, in Coloss.;
Augustine, Enarr. in Psal. 33, and Epist. i. ad Volusiana3
’ Daumscenus, De orthod. fide, lib. 4. cap. 18.; Theodoret,
De curand. Graec. affect. lib. 8, not far from the beginning3
all advise it. To these I add two testimonies of Count
Mirandula z* the former is drawn from the Preface to his
Heptaplum3 All the Israelitislz multitude, cobblers, coolcs,
dealem, slzepltercls, servants, maidens, to all whom the law was
delivered to be read, could not bear the burdeiz qs tlte whole
Iisosaz‘c wisdom. The latter testimony is extracted from
his Exposit. orat. Domin. Tlee Evangelical hist-013( ought to
be contiuually read by every Christian man. ’

Yon may see the arguments, by which Bellarmin and
other Papists endeavour to take away the reading of the

and a preface to Erasmus's works. He was a particular friend of Erasmus,
who entertained a high opinion of liis attainments as a scholar and a critic,
and of his character as a man. He died at his native place, in the commu-
nion of the Romish faith, in 1547. Yet one of his pieces, de Primatu
Petri, is in the Index Libror. Prohib. of Benedict XlV.‚ together with
his Annotations on Tertullian's works. He was opposed to the Court 01
Rome's usurpation of temporal power.

† Dr. William Whitaker, the justly celebrated Blaster of St. Jolm's,
Cambridge, at the period when our Expositor commenced his College career,
and who first noticed Davenant's abilities and genius. He was a native ot
Lancasffire, and educated at St. Paul's School‚ whence he preceeded to Tri-
nity College, Cambridge, of which he became a Fellow. He was after-
wards made Professor of Divinity at Cambridge, and Chancellor of St.
Paul's Cathedral in 1579; but resigned this latter preferment on being ap-
pointed Master of St. John's. He displayed his learning by Greek Transla-
tions of the English Liturgy‚ and of Dean Nowell's Catechism, and in his
different College Theses and Lectures; but still more in his zeal for the

might be questioned, whether he shewed himself more the pious Christian
*or the learned Divine; by the latter he became esteemed as one of the
most eminent Protestant l'olemics of the age3 proving himself extremely
