3. From the commendation of all those who have ap*
plied themselves to the reading of the Scriptures. The
eunuch is commended Acts viii. 283 the Bereans, Acts
xvii. 11 : yea, all are pronounced blessed who become assi-
duous in the study of the Scriptores, Ps. i.

4. From the case of the Apostles ; who, as they preach-
ed publicly the mysteries of salvation to the people, so also,
by their Epistles‚ they recommendet} the whole doctrine
to be read by the same. For it is most absurd for any oue
to say that what was heretofore written as much to the peo-
ple as to the clergy, is not now proper to be read by the
people. We may instance the Epistles to the Romans,
Corinthiam, Galatians, EphesianS.

5. From the utility and necessity of this study. By

tion and understanding of the people. And B. Rhenanus,
in Annotat. to Tertullian's book De corona militis, says,

”⁵ Beatus Rhenanus, anative of Schelestat‚ or Slestad‚ in Alsace, where
he was born in the year 1485. He was one of those men of learning who
do not¹ einbiace any particular profession, and whose only business is to cul-
tivate the sciences, and do service to the learned world3 of the classical at-
tainnients of which he possessed a considerable share, and was likewise well
skilled in Divinity. His favourite employ was correcting or explaining ec-
clesiastieal or profane authors, several of the works of both which classes he
puhlished with notes or introductory prefiwes, and which were in general
much esteemed. Tertullian's treatises were the first he publsshed, with an.
notations on the peculiar words and difficult phrases ofthat author, and pre-
faces to most of his pieces. But he distinguished himself most by a history
of Germany, published iu 1531, in 410. and which Du Pin entitles “ a
