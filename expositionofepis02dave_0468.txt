458 A D¹SSERTAT10N ON ΤΗΕ DEATH or cnmsr.

Lastly, The testimony of the venerable Bede is most ex-
press, in his Commentaries on 2 Cor. v. 19, The world is
reconcilea' to Goa' byfaith, when it believes in Christ, who was
seut by God. The Apostle had said, God was in Christ re-
conciling the world unco himself, that is, that Christ by the
ordination of God paid that ransom to the Father, by which
it was effected that God should not demand satisfaction
from us for our sins, before he returned into favour with
us3 but being content with this alone, is ready to receive
any one into favour. If you enquire further, whether on
the payment of this price all men are immediately recon-
ciled by the act of payment‘l Bede answers, By no means;
but every one is 'rnen reconciled to God, when he believes in
Christ, who was sent by God. To the same effect are the
words of the same author on Luke xv, Then Christ is slain
Jbr every one eff us, when we believe that he was slain. He
was slain from the origin of the world in the Divine accepta-
tion ; he was slain also when the fulizess of time came upon the
crass. But he was slainfor you and for me, that is, sor every
individual, when we believe in him that was slain. Which is
the same as if he had said, The benefit of the death of
Christ belongs to us when we begin to believe in him.
They have therefore departed from orthodox antiquity‚ who
assert that all men are placed in a state of grace by the
passion of Christ3 nor less so they who teach that the pre-
destinated, by this death of Christ, have obtained remis-
sion of their sins, or justification and reconciliation with
God from eternity3 since this justification or actual recon-
ciliation (as Bernard truly and learnedly remarks) cannot be
without the consent (ff the receiver, any more than without the
graceof the Giver. And thus you have our, opinion con-
firmed and strengthened. WVe shall now bring forward the
objections of adversaries, and remove them in a few
words.
