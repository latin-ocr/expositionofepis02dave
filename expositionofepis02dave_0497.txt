comes to this, That the grace of the Gospel is not given
to men because they are judged worthy of it, since no
man is found worthy of so great a gift3 nor is it denied to
men because they are more unworthy than others, since
this light has been granted to the worst, while at the sanie
time it has been denied to those who were less depraved.
We must, therefore, acquiesce in the secret good pleasure
of God, who, that his mercy may shirie rnore conspicu-
ously, does not regularly grant the light of the Gospel to
those who have made a good or a less bad use of the light
of nature, but on the contrary, calls to himself the sloth-
ful and the negligent, and unworthy and ungrateful sin-
ners. And hence it appears, that God always rein-ains free
and that it is in no way inconsistent with his goodness to
give or not to give to any men the Gospel, and other means
necessary for the application of the merits of Christ, ac-
cording to the good pleasure of his will, no account being
taken of man's worthiness or unworthffless, or his greater
or less unworthiness.

ARGUMENT 4. The same rnay be proved by the mani-
fest inconsistencies by which the contrary opinion is main-
tained. For if by the death of Christ it has been univer-
sally obtained that God should be bound by a fixed decree
or by some law of congruity as much as possible, to grant
to all rnen individually the grace of the preaching of the
Gospel, and of internal sanctification, then it would fol-
low, that the prirnary reason why one is actually made·
partaker of both these gifts, and another is not, consists
in this, that the one by opposing an obstacle repels this
grace, or altogether prevents it from being offered to him,
the other neither repels it nor hinders it. Our adversaries
do not avoid this consequence. For they do not restrain
the difference of the call of the Gospel and saving grace
being denied or granted, to the mere will of God, but to
various conditions or dispositions considered on the part
of men. Thus Corvinus* sayS, (contra Tilen. p. 489) Al-
