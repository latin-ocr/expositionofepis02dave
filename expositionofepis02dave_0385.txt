the whole world of mankind. The same form of speaking is
every where made use of in the Articles of religion of our
Church of England, (Art. 2, 15, 31, Sto.) Thus also those
speak who endeavour to limit to the utmost this death of
Christ. We adduced before the testimony of the Reverend
Heidelberg Divine Pareus, who freely confesses in his
judgment Dexhibited at the Synod of Dort, lee cause and
matter of tlze passzon os (krist was afeelmg 07 sustaim'ng (ff

that without any other intervening condition, all men should
be immediately absolved through the offering of the ob-
