2. Itis not sufficient to season our speech with any
kind of salt, but we must do it with the salt of wisdom.
Therefore let that salt of satirica] virulence be discarded,
with which it is too much the custom with the petulant to
season, or rather to embellish their conversation. Neither

others also by this contagious discourse, the piety and fear
of God which they themselves have cast off. But all these
have not salt in themselves3 but consumpffion, putridity,
and poison, which they labour to infuse into all others.

Thus much concerning the exhortation itself; about
