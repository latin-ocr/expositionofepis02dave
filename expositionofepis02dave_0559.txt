self could not deny that the redemption completed on the
cross pertains in some peculiar way to the elect. For thus
he speaks (in Amica duplic. p. 230) lc appears that the
word redemptz'on may be applied in a different sense to many
species of tlze same genus ; and therefore it may be properly
said, that some only, and not all, were redeemed in some special
way ον peculim sense, and so it is usually said in the lzoly Scrip-
tures. Again (page 235‚) answering a passage produced
from Heb. xiii. 20, in which Christ is called The great Slzep·
herd of tlze sheep, through the blood of tlze ecerlasting cove-
nant, he grants, that Christ is the Shepherrl of tlzese sheep,
and indeed of tlzese only, in a peculiar way, namely, as to tlze

saving (md spiritual act offeeding them, which contains tlte
actual gift (ff the Holy Spirit ; and also as to some special ac- -

den. Having accepted this offer, he soon became involved in the contro-
versial war which raged in the Netherlands ς and the Gomarists, or nigid
Calvinists‚ taking advantage of a book which he had lately published‚ en-
titled‚ Tractatus Theologicus de Deo, sive de Natura et Attributiis Dei, they
accused him of heresy, and engaged several foreign Universities in the
party. In particular, they obtained the aid of our own James 1., who, on
receiving the book of Vorstius‚ in an hour's time drew up a large Catalogue
of heresies from it, which he sent to his minister at the Hague, with an
order to certify to the States how much he detested those alleged errors·
He also caused his book to be burnt in London 3 and informed the States,
who had sent a doubtful reply that they would inquire into the case, that if
they did not dismiss Vorstius‚ none of his subjects should visit Leyden.
James moreover wrote against Vorstius‚ who respectfully replied; all
which would not have prevailed upon the states to dismiss him, but for the
untimely appearance of a book by some of his disciples‚ entiffled, De Officio
Christiani Hominis, which contained some Anti-trinitarian doctrines3 and
although formally disclaimed by Vorstius‚ so much odium was thereby ex.
cited against him, that he provisionally resigned the professorship, from
which, by the Synod of Dort, he was entirely dismissed, and banished by
the §tates of Holland from their territories. He lived for more than two
years in secrecy, frequently changing-his abode in fear for his life, until in
1623 the Duke of Holstein collected the dispersed followers of Arminianism,
and assigned them a spot of ground for building a city. To this place Vor⁴=
stius retired, but died soon after at Toningen, in Sept. 1622, at the age of
53. According to Bayle and Sandius, the opinions of this theologian pro.
bably leaned towards Socinianism, or at least he dogmatized on the attributes
of God in a manner which was quit-e unusual at the period—The Reader
who desires to see a more ample account of him and his opinions, may con-

236.
