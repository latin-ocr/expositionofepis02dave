exaltation of Christ himself. The Apostle now enters upon
that other part of his admonition‚ by which he forbids us
to seek and to affect earthly things3 and he corroborates it
by two other arguments. The first taken from our spiritual
death3for με are dead: to which he adds a silent occupa-
tion; your life is leid. The latter is derived from the cer-
tain expectation of future glory. And this certainty is
shewn by the circumstance of the time assigned when this
life of glory shall be given us; namely, when Christ shall
appear. We shall begin from the former reason.

For yse are dead] Namely, to sin, to the world, and to

. the fiesh; as the Apostle constantly testifies. Reclcon yle

² yourselves to be dead indeed unco sin, Rom. vi. 11. The world
is crucffied unto me, and I meto the world, Gal. vi. 143 And
elsewhere, They who are Christ's have crucffied the flesh with
the affections ancl lusts. Here let us consider two things:
’ How we are dead 3 and,- How much this consideration pre-
vails to the slighting of earthly things.

As to the first3 They that are born again are dead to sin,
not because sin is wholly eradicated and extirpated from
their mortal body3 for this would oppose every one's ex-
perience who perceives within himself the fuel of sin: but
because its dominion is broken, weakened, and debilitated 3
because its power is gradually subdued by the operation of
grace3 because at length it shall be wholly overcome and
extinguished by the perfectiori of glory. Whoever, there-
fore, are born again in Christ are dead to sin, because all
their sins are abolished‚ in the sacrament of regeneration,
as to the guilt3 because they are sealed to be entirely abo-
lished, even as to the act, and begin to be abolished by
the Spirit- operating within3 finally, because believers are
bound to mortify them, on account of the vow of mortifi-
cation undertaken at baptism. Therefore, as in common
language we say that he is already α dead man, against
whom sentence of death is passed 3 so we rightly say, that
they who are born again are (lead, or that sin is already dead
in them, because in their baptism the sentence of death
was as it were passed against sin3 the execution of which
sentence is forthwith begun, is daily proceeding, and at
