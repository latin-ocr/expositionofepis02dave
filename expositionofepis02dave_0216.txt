206 AN ExposiTloN or ST. PAUL's Cleap. iii.

This celestial reward, therefore, is called merceS, hire or
wages; not because men are able to merit it by the excel-
lence of their works, but because it bears a resemblance to
a reward in certain other circumstances.

l. As hire is not given except to labourers and work-
men 3 so the heavenly kingdom is not given to the indo-
lent, but to those striving in their vocation.

2. As hire is not wont to be given except after the works
are finished; so life eternal is not bestowed unless after
the course of this life is ended.

Now in two other respects the heavenly reward is unlike
hire.

l. Hire is given according to the merit of the work-
man3 but the heavenly reward is given from the grace aud
liberality of the bestower‚ Luke xvii. 10.

2. Hire is proportioned to the labours for which it is
bestowed3 but the heavenly reward hath no proportion to
our services for which it is a reward ; forfinz'te bath no pro-
portion to irfinite. Therefore this same reward is called an
inheritance, because it pertains to the pious and faithful by
right of sonship. And by this word he comforts Christian
servants: For as they could not receive any reward from
their eartbly masters, who looked upon them as slaves3
yet they are to receive an inherilance from God, who ac·
counts thern as sons : and it behoves them to expect this
reward (ff the inlzeritance.

Concerning this inheritance due to believers by right of
adoption, the Apostle thus speaks in Rom. viii. 15, Ye
have received the Spirit (ff adoption whereby we cry Abba,
Father. And {f children, tlzen heirs ; heirs (gf God, aud joint
heirs with Clzrist; vers. 17.

Corollaries.

l. No vocation is so mean and abject, to which a reward
is not promised by God, is only men conduct themselves
piously in the same. We are not, therefore, to consider
how honourable our vocation may be; but labour rather,
that whatever in truth it may be (so that it is lawful and

honest) it may be discharged well by us, and with a good
conscience. llcnce that counsel of the Apostle, lCor.
