ing to the Divine ordination, to the whole human race, or
only to individuals, and to certain persons 111 particular.
We contend that it was confirmed with the whole. human
race. Which may appear, First, from the command and
promise of Christ himself, who, after he had endured and
conquered death, sent his Apostles into all the world,
(Mark xvi. 15, 16) And he said meto them, Go με into all
the world, and preach tlze G'ospel to every creature. He that
believetlz and is baptised shall be saved, but lte tleal believetlz not
shall be damned. On which words of promise, the learned
Calvin has rightly remarked, leat this promise was added
that it might allure llze whole human race to tlzefaz'llz. (Harm.
Evang. p. 374). Itis therefore understood to have been

respect of nation or predestination‚ boldly promise forgive-
ness of sins on condition of faith to each and every per-
son who assembles to hear them. By this act they acknow-

through faith„ confirmed by the blood of Christ, is univer-

posed, and a benefit annexed be promised conditionally to
those persons to whom the covenant itself is not extended
by the will of the maker of it. For example, if a King
makes an agreement with certain persons who have been
found guilty of high treason, that he will pardon them if
they will humbly ask pardon of him3 it would not be law-
ful for this reason for any of the King's servants to go to
the prison and announce to* all persons there promiscu-
ously‚ that pardon would be obtained from the King, if
they would only humbly kneel down and ask it; because
this conditional agreement regards those only who are in-
cluded in it by the Royal clemency. Therefore neither
would it be lawful sor the ministers of God to promise
promiscuously to all men remission and salvation 011 the
