rare for the most part pious towards God: for as Hugo de
St. Victor has well said, De sacram. lib. l. cap. 7, tlzis pa-
ternity is to us the sign and image (ff the divine paternity ‚· so
that the human heurt may learn by that principle which it sees,
what it owes to that principle from which it is derived, and
which ic does not see. Thus much concerning the matter of
the precept3 Now let us discuss its breadth and latitude.

3. In all things] The Apostle appears to extend filial
obedience to all things which are enjoined by parents,
without excepting justice aud equity: for universal and
absolute obedience is due to God alone. But the limita-
tion and explication of this charge may be obtained from
Ephes. vi. l, where. he expresses what remains to be under-

that is, as far as it is allowed by God; or, as we may ga-

2. In things general and indifferent in their nature, it
behoves children to obey their parents. For although the
things prescribed be free and indifferent in their nature3
yet obedience, when the parental command is interposed,
is not at one's pleasure, bnt under a mandate. For truly
and wisely was it said by Gerson, De relig. perfect. part.

⁸3, In things indifferent we must especially cotfide in thejztdg-
ment of a superior ; since he tells us in the place of God wlcat
is expedient and what is proper.

3. Although the injunctions of parents may seem harsh
and unjust, yet if they contain nothing of impiety they
must be obeyed, especially by children not yet set free
from parental authority. We have a remarkable example
