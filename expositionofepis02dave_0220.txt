210 AN EXPOSITION οι· sT. PAUL’S Claap.iii.

ponding to his iniquity. We have a sample of this Divine
vengeance upon the Egyptian oppressors; whom God af-
flicted with much heavier punishments than they were able
to afflict their Israelitish servants: and upon Saul, who is
punished in his posterity for the wrong done to the slaugh-
tered Gibeonites‚ 2 Sam. xxi.

Other interpreters refer this commination to servants
themselves: as though the Apostle hadsaid, If the expec-
tation of the heavenly reward cannot inflame you to fulfil
your duty; this at least should excite you, that God him-
self will punish, either your contumacy‚ or your idleness.
For contumacious servants, who despise their masters and
regard them not of a straw, do wrong to them, as far as
they do not pay them due obedience and reverence: the
slothful and deceitful also are deemed to wrong their mas-
ters, because they either do not yield them due submis-
sion, or not with that faith and sincerity of heart with
which they should have done. If, then, servants, by these
or any other means, do wrong to their masters, they shall
receive for the wrong done: that is, they shall be punished
for their dishonesty by God, the judge and avenger. We
have on record the example of Gehazi, 2 Kings v.

ButI think with Jerome that both interpretations should
be united ; as well because the Apostle addresses all gene-
rally, as especially because he has placed this commina-
tion between the duties of servants and masters, that it
may extend to both, and that equally. Thus, then, Iex-
plain the words of the Apostle3 He thal doeth wr0ng; whe-
ther he be the master, by afflicting his servant unjustly3 or
the servant, by despising or defrauding his master3 each
shall receivefor the wrong which Ize ltatlz done, that is, shall
be severely punished by the Supreme Lord God according
to the weight of his sin.

Instructions.

1. In all sin (although men may indulge the hope of
impunity, yet) it is determined by God himself that the
punishments which impend over sinners shall be inflicted.
And what can it profit to have avoided the avenging hand
of men, and to fall into the hands of the living God ’.ἱ
