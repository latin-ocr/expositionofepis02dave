Ver. 17. EPISTLE το THE cotossmNs. 147

Every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under
the earth, &c. heard I saying, Blessing‚ and honour, and glory,
and power, be unto him that sz'tteth upon the throne, and unto
the Lambfor ever and ever. Hither ought all our good ac-
tions to ,have respect3 otherwise, as Augustine has well
said, contra Julian, lib. 4. cap. 3, Whatever good is done,
and is not done for the eudsor which it ought to be done, al-
though it seems to be good in the performauce, yet the final
cause itsels not being the right one, z't is sin.

But also those actions which are indifferent in their na·
ture, yet ought to be done by Christians in the name of
Christ, that is (as we have explained it) according to the
will of Christ, and for the glory of Christ. For although
any one may eat, drink, and perform other such like ac-
tions as 311 animal or 3 111311, Christ being neither invoked .
nor thought upon 3 yet he cannot do these things at all as
becometh a Christian, unless by Christ.

The reasons are these;

1. We have no right to these creatures unless in Christ:
therefore he is guilty of theft who, receiving things belong-
ing to another against the will of God, takes to himself, 111
his own name, the creatures to his use : For alt things are
ours when we are Christ's‚ l Cor. iii.22, 23. Therefore, 31-
though 3 civil authority is acquired by other modes3 yet
that evangelical authority, which gives us the faculty of
using the creatures without injury to God, depends upon
Christ.

2. Because, although we might have 3 right to the
creatures without Christ3 yet they are not blessed by God,
nor sanctified to our use, without Christ. Therefore on
this account there is need of invoking the name of Christ,
and the influence of Christ with his Father. For what the
Apostle says concerning meats, l Tim. iv. 5, They are sanc-
tfied by the word of God and prayer, that also is to be ac-
commodated to all the other creatores z but the efficacy of
prayer depends upon the name of Christ.

3. Because we are bound, even in things and actions
indifferent in their nature, for instance, in food, and cloth-
ing, and other things of that kind, to retain that mode, and
