Father, that he might bring an universal remedy applicable
to the whole world. Nor can the sense be restrained to the

world of the elect. For, first, this world, to save which
Christ was sent is divided into believers and unbelievers.
But the world of the elect consists only of believers, or at
least, of those who shall ultimately believe. Secondly,
because some will be condemned, to save whom it is here
affirmed Christ was sent. But none of the elect shall be
damned. Thirdly, because those who are here declared to
be condemned, are said to have come un'der condemnation
because they lzave not believed in tlze only begotlen Son
qs God, or, because they leave rejected lzim. In which
manner of speaking, it is implied in a way sufficiently
perspicuous, that he. was offered to them by God, and sent
to save them. But how, or in what sense can we rightly
understand that Christ was sent to save those who perish
by their own fault, that is, through their own unbelief?
Not otherwise than is expressed in our proposition3
namely‚ that the death of Christ is an universal cause of
salvation appointed byGod and applicable to every man on
the condition of fasth, which condition these by their own
voluntary wickedness have despised. Thus did Calvin un-
derstand these words3 for on John iii. he has observed,
Thac tlze word wonro is repeated again and again, tlzat no
one might suppose that lze should he driven away, if lie lcept
tlze way ‹fffaitlz. And on John xii. 47, he has obsewed,
In order tlzat tlte minds (ff all men might be inclined to repen-
tance, salvation is here offered to all men without distinction.
It appears, therefore, from these passages, that the
death of Christ is to be proposed and considered as a re-
medy, applicable to all men for salvation, by the appoint-
ment of God, although it may he rejected by the unbe-
lieving.
