Ver. 5. Erlsrilu To THE cotossmNS. 31

Verse 5.

Jlsortify therefbre your members which are upon the eartlz ;
fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affatim, evil con—
cupiscence, and co'vecousness which is idolatry.

Having gone through that former part of the exhortation
which teaches us what is to be sought without us, and what
to be avoided; the Apostle proceeds, and teaches what is to
be extirpated and abolished within us, what is to be nou-
rished and cherished. That former part directed us to seek
the true end, viz. celestial blessedness3 this directs us to en-

a particular enumeration of certain vicious deeds and affec-
tions which he would have to be mortified.

Ilffortffy therefore your members which are upon the earth]
In these words you have the general exhortation to the
practice of mortification. We may observe in them,

First, the connexion or dependence of the words; for the
illative particle therefore, compels us to look to what goes
before. They are thus then connected with the foregoing
words ε Because yse are risen with. Christ, because ye are dead
witlz Christ, because με have a glorious lg'fe hid iu Christ,
THEREFORE mortisyyour members, διο. Hence we infer that
our participation with Christ in dying, rising again, and as-
cending, is the strongest inducement to newness of life
aud holiness.

Secondly. Let us consider the act itself to which we
