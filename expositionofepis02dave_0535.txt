Repu. Ι answer, that in this promise, by which God
the Father as it were bound himself to the Mediator, to
give him a seed, if he should lay down his soul for sin, a
tacit promise is contained of giving saith to the elect.
without which they would not be the seed of Christ. It
vvas therefore decreed by God on account of the death of
his Son, to give faith to some persons, as wellas to give a
progeny to his Son which should live for ever. Christ
being aware beforehand of this promise and counsel, could
not offer the sacrifice of his death to God the Father‚
without a special design for this seed, who should here-
after believe in him.—So far we have contended from ex· <
press testimonies of the scriptur-effi let us now bring for-
ward some arguments founded also in the holy Scriptures.
ARGUMENT 1. He who by his death not only estab-
lished the evangelical covenant which regards all rnen pro-

effectual application of the merits of Christ, and describes
the privileges of the elect, or the spiritual Israel. Now I
add the minor, and affirm, That Christ, by his death, is
the Mediator of this secret covenant‚ which includes its
application, and embraces the Israel of God, or the elect
children of God, and them alone. Besides the words of the
prophetjust quoted, we have also the clear testimony of
the Apossse, citing the same prophet, (Heb. viii. 6) Οιιι·
