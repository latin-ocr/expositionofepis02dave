222 AN EXPOSirroN or ετ. PAUL'S Clmp. iv.

Master who dares to violate justice and equity. lee wick-
ed and his ungodliness are botlz alike lzatefful emto God, Wisd.
xiv. 9.

Thirdly‚ because this Master in heaven, is Almighty: he
therefore can punish that which he hates; nor can any one
pluck himself out of his hands. He is the Ruler over all,
neither stands in awe of any man’s greatness: and a strong-
et· than the strongest shall bring a sore trial upon the miglzty,
Wisd. vi. 7, 8. Let masters, then, think of these things:
that they have a Master3 that they have a Master in hea-
ven, i. e. all-seeing, a hater of all injustice, and almighty z
and this shall constrain them to renderjustice and equity
to their servants.

Hence learn,

1. That the faithful and godly should so carry them-
selves towards their inferior-s, as always to remember that
they have a higher Master.

2. That it is too much the custom among men of pow-
er and appointed to high station, to forget this supreme and
common Master.

3. This forgetfulness is the origin of all injustice and
iniquity: as is evident in Pharaoh, Exod- v. 2, Ι know noc
tlze Lord; I will not let Israel go.

4. We therefore should perpetually think what aMaster
we have in heaven, that this very thought may be a stimu-
lus to excite us to equity‚ and a restraint to keep us from
injustice and tyranny.

5. lt behoves us to treat our servants with that clemency
which we desire that our heavenly Master may use towards

us.
And thus ye have an explication of this economical ex-

hortation, as it were, of the Apostle3 which we have re-
ferred to the third Chapter. Now let us proceed to the
exposition of the last Chapter.
