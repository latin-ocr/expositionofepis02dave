cording· to which God proceeds in dispensing or denying
the Gospel either to individuals or to nations. Which
things being granted, it will follow, that unworthiness is
always found in those to whom the Gospel is denied3 but
it is in those also to whom it is granted. Therefore this
unworthiness will have the nature of a circumstance which
always accoinpanies the persons to whom the Gospel is
given or not given3 but it will not be a, cause of discrimi-
nation why the Gospel is given to one and not given to
another. Therefore in this matter we rnust come to the
good pleasure of the Divine will alone, who, as it pleases
him, grants his aid both to those who do and to those who
do not what. they can, as Alvarez says (De Auxil. disp. 58.)
But since this answer, which teaches that the grace of the
Gospel is repelled by the unworthiness of men, seems
tacitly to 'lsint that it may be procured hy some degree of
worthiness in them, let us hear what the orthodox Fathers
have taught against the Pelagians in this matter. Augus-
tine (Epist. 107, p. 500) shews that the saving grace of
Christ is not granted nor denied to men according to this
rule of greater or less unworthiness. His words have been
before quoted. Prosper very often inculcates this (De
vocat. Gent. lib. l, cap. 15), Part of men are delivered,
while another part perish: bnt if we would ascribe this to the
merits of their wz'lls, that z't might appear that the wz'clced had
neglected grace and the good had chosen it, the case of people
innumerahle will oppose ns, who throughout so many ages have
not been enl‘ightened by the preachz'ng of the heavenly doctrine.
Nor can we say, that their posterity were am) better, upon whom
the light has arisen, διο. Again (in Carmine de Ingratis,
cap. 12) Prosper shews that this was the very sentiment of
the Pelagians‚ namely‚ that God of his own goodness was
willing to call all men to grace, but that the will of some,
thee'rfirst light having been extinguished by their scices, had
made itself unworlhy ofa second. But he contendS‚ that on
the contrary, examples may be produced (cap. 14) which
shew that the hearts of the adelred, in whom nothing good had
ever clu-ele, aud who had no sign or sense of rfghteousnes& were
converted by the power (f God. The sum of the argument
