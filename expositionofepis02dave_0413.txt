gree, and to exceed all their debts, yet if there should not
be added to this the intention and act of offer-ing for cer-
tain captives, although such a ransom should be ever so
copious and superabundant, considered in itself and from
its intrinsic value, yet what was said of the sufficiency
may be said of the superabundance, that there was a mere
superabundance of the thing, but that it effected nothing
as yet for the liberation of the persons aforesaid. Now to
this mere sufficiency, which regards nothing else than the
equal or superabundant worth of the appointed price of re-
demption, Ioppose another, which, for the sake of per-
spicuity, I shall call ordained szgfficiencq. This is under-
stood when the thing which has respect to the ransom, or
redemption price, is not only equivalent to, or superior in
value to the thing redeemed, but also is ordained for its-
redemption by some wish to offer or actual offering. Thus
a thousand talents laid up in the treasury of a prince are
said to be a sufficient ransom to redeem ten citizens taken
captive by an enemy; but if there is not an intention to
offer, and an actual offering and giving these talents for
those captives, or for some of them, then a mere and not
an ordained sufficiency of the thing is supposed as to those
persons for whom it is not given. But if you add the act
and intention offering them for the liberation of certain
persons, then the ordained sufficiency is asserted as to
them alone. Further, this ordained sufficiency of the ran-
som for the redemption of a captive may be twofold : Ab-
solute 3 when there is such an agreement between him who
gives and him who receives this price of redemption for
the liberation of the captives, that as soon as the price is
paid, on the act of payment the captives are immediately
delivered. Conditiona13 when the price is accepted, not
that it may be paid immediately, and the captive be re-
stored to liberty; but that h'e should be delivered under a
condition if he should first do something or other. leeu
