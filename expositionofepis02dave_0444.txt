434 A nissenrArioN os THE DEATH or cnaisr.

drinus truly remarks (Strom. lib. 4, p. 235,) While we are
iu this life there is no time either too late or too soon to obtain
the healtlz (ff tlte soul. Who shall receive faith and repen-
tance from God before he departs out of this life, and who
shall not receive thern, is a secret, depending on the will
of him who bath mercy on whom lze will have mercy. and
wliom he will Ite leaves hai-dened. (Rom. ix, 18.) ln the
mean time, if we regard the ordinary law of God, we shall
rightly say of any persons still continued in this life, as
Augustiue says (De Praed. Sanct- cap. 5.) All men slave not
saith, but the possibility of haviugfaitla z's common to all.

Against this our opinion, which makes faith a condition
possible to any living person, and the death of Christ ap-
plicable‚ through that possible condition, to any man,
some things may be objected.

1. The most common objection is, leat power is in
vain, which is not brought into action. For to what pur-

greater part of men (e,

We reply, As far as relates to the power of God, this
saying is by no means to be admitted. Because, as Aqui.-
nas learnedly observes, (Part. i. qu. 25, art. ii. resp. ad. 2)
T hat is in vain whiclz is ordainedjor an end whiclz it does not
accain: but tlze power of God is not ordainedfor any] erlernal
effect as its end, but is itsesf rather tlze end of its own effect.
Therefore, although God should not have created the
world, nor should save any mortal man, yet the power in
God of creating and saving would not be vain or needless.
For a like reason that power is not in vain in God or in
Christ, by which he is able, according to a law made and
promulgated by himself, to bestow upon any living man
the grace of faith and repentance, although he wil-l not
vouchsafe that grace to multitudes of the human race.
Now as to the receptive power, which God hath willed
