3. Nothing is more pernicious or more dangerous to the
Church, than those perfidious brethren who feign religion,
when they despise it in their heart. Paul thought these
false brethren to be robbers, pagens, yea, worse than all
storms and shipwrecks: Hence when he would write a ca-
talogue of his dangers, he cites in the last place the dan-
gers which he had undergone among false brethren, as
greater than all the rest, 2 Cor. xi. 26.
