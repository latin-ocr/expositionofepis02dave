willing to appoint such a Redeemer, through whose death
and satisfaction any one, provided he should believe in
him, might be absolved from his sins. Acts xiii. 38. But
we think that it is to be attributed to his special good plea-
sure, with which he embraces the elect alone, that from
the death and merit of this appointed and ordained Re-
deemer, he should determine to give to certain individual
persons effectually and infallibly, saith, remission of sins, and
eternal life. And we think that the Saviour referred 'to
this special intention, John x. 15, where he says, that he
laid down lzis life for his sheep, that is, that he so offered

berty in dispensing or not dispensing that special grace,
by means of which fuith is infallibly produced in the hearts
of men, and an effectual application is secured, and eter-
nal life is infallibly obtained according to the covenant of
the Gospel.

which he designs. If, therefore, he had ordained the
death of Christ to procure the salvation of the human ruce,
he would also have saved the whole human race by means
of this death of Christ. Those, therefore, who assert that
the death of Christ is, through the ordination of God him-
self, appointed to be a remedy applicable to all nien for
salvation, seem to impugn the wisdom of God. For he
has very little wisdom who designs a thing which he does
not accomplish. They seen] also to impugn the omnipo-
tence of God. For it is the act of a weak person to or-
