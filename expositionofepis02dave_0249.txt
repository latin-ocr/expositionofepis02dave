rial and meritorious intercession of dead saints for the
church militant. For the living do not offer ineritorious
prayers to God for the living, but only suppliantly unite
their prayers with those of their brethren. But whoever
does this on another’s account, does not set himself up as
an intercessor properly so called, or as the advocate of
another3 but only joins suppliantly in the same petitions.
Therefore‚ whatever may be determined about the univer-
sal prayers of the church triumphant for the safety of the
church militant, it should ever be remembered, that Christ
is the only Mediator both of redemption and of merito-
rious intercession with God the Father. Thus much of the
persons.

'l'lzut God τωωιιίιί open meto as α dom· (f interanea] Here
he proceeds to shew what he most especially wished that·
they should ask from God on his account and that of other
ininisters, namely, that he would open a door of utterance
to them. Christ, in Luke xxi. 15, calls this faculty, α
mouth, andwlsdonw Ι will give yson α mouth, ancl wisdom,
which all-your adversaries shall not be able to gaz‘nsay 7107' re-
sist. And wisely indeed does the Apostle require this door
of his soul to be opened by God3 because he alone illumi-
nates the minds of men in this knowledge of Divine things,
he alone furnishes the gifts requisite for the discharge of
such an office. He opened a door of utterance to Moses,
who was hy nature slom of speech, and of α slew tongue,
Exod. iv. lO. And in the same place he manifestly claims
this prerogative to himself, vers. ll, 12: Who lzatlz made
man’s mouth ? Have not I tlze Lord? Now therefore go. ancl
Ι will be zez‘tlz thy mouth, [md teaclz thee wlzat thou shall say.
So also Paul refers his faculty to the gratuitous gift of
God, 2 Cor. iii. 5, 6, Noc tlzac we are sufficient of ourselves,
but 0117· sufficiencjs is (gf God:.wh0 ΙιαΙΙι made us able minis-
