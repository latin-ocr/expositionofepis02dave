stand that the application would be hindered by some in-
tervening obstacle, which he had not determined to re-
move. Here may be adduced that question of Aquinas on
predestination, where he makes a difference between provi-
dence commonly taken, and predestination, which is a spe-
cial part of providence. Propidence, he says, respects only
an order co cm end: predestination respects tlze end or event os
an order. leose things which are ordained to an end by that
more common providenoe, do not always obtain the end,· but
those things which are ordazned by an zndivz'dual predestmation
always obtain it. As therefore God, by that more exten-
sive providence‚ is understood to have provided many bo-
dily remedies applicable to the removing of certain bodily
diseases from any persons, which nevertheless he hath not
determined to be infallibly applied to any particular indi-
viduals; so also we affirm that God of his love to man,
and that more common providence, hath provided and or-
dained the blood of his Son as a remedy applicable to the
expiation of the sins of mankind in general, although he
hath not determined from his individual predestination to
have it applied to all men individually. But for what pur-
pose is that ordained as applicable to all men, which is not
intended to be infallibly applied to all? Ianswer, that
from hence the good-will, mercy, and justice of God may
appear more conspicuous, whilst that remedy which, from
the ordination of God, is applicable to every one for salva-
tion‚ is applied nevertheless only to certain persons, to
whom God shews his compassion in a special manner3 it is
not applied to others, although God promises it and sets
it before them, through their own wickedness.
OBJECTloN 3. If the death of Christ, by the ordina-
tion of God, is a remedy applicable to all for salvation‚
then God would take care that this death of Christ should
be announced to all, lest any one might pretend that he
perished only through ignorance of so efficacious a re-
medy. But experience teaches, that this remedy was not
revealed, for some ages, not only to many individuals‚ but
also to many nations: Therefore that was not appointed
by God to be a remedy applicable to all men individually,
