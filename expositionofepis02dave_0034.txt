first, the matter contained in these words in itself: se-
condly, we shall show the force of the consequence3 that
it may be understood how it tends to establish this con-
clusion, Earthly things are not to be affected by us.

In the former part three things are to be considered : the
Author of the gift3 the time of the bestowa13 the gift
itself.

1. The Author, or the Cause of the glorious and blessed
life which we expect, is Christ himself: Whence he is
called our lffe by a causal not an essential predication3 be-
cause it was he that promised this life to us, it was he that
merited it for us, it was he prepared it, he that will be-
stow it. He promisd it, in the name of the Fat-her, Luke
xii.32, Fear not, little floclc;for ic is your Father's good
pleasare to give you the lcingdonu and in his own name,
John x. 28, Igive anto them elernal lise, διο. He merited
it, 1 John iv. 9, God sent his only begotten Son into the world
that we might live through lzim,· and l John v. ll, God hatlz
given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. And he
hath prepared us for this life, and this eternal life for us.
He hath prepared us, and made us meet for the participa-
tion of this life by his Spirit3 lle lzatlz made us meet to be
parlalcers of the inheritance of the saints in light, Col. i. 12.
He hath quichened us together with Christ.- by grace ye are
saved, Ephes. ii. 5. He hath also prepared this kingdom
for us by his ascension3 I go to prepare aplace for you:
And if I go aud prepare a place foryou, Ι will come again
and receive you to myself; that where Ι am, there με may be
also, John xiv. 23. Finally, he will bestow upon his peo-
ple this crown of eternal life3 Thou hast given him power
over all flesh, that he should give ecernal lise to as many as thou
hast given him, John xvii. 2. There z's laid upfor me a crown
(ff righleousness which the Lord shall give me, 2 Tim. iv. 8.
Christ, then is rightly called our life, i. e. the author or the
cause of our eternal life: as it is in Heb. v. 9, And being
made perfect, he became the author (ff eternal salvation. to all
them that ohe-y him.

2. Now let us consider the circumstances of time:
When he shall appear, 'ruEN wc shall obtain a glorious life.
