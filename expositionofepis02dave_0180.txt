many yield reverence and honour to their parentS, who yet
fail to render obedience in the course of their life.

But we must also observe that he says, not tofatleers,
but to parents,- for in this word both parents are included;
and that properly too: for a son derives his origin from
both; therefore to both, that is, both father and mother,
he owes ohedience and reverence. Vide Prov. xxiii. 22.

In this very word parents, is implied the most powerful
argument, yea, many arguments, which ought to impel
children to obedience. For as soon as the epithet parents,
sounds in the ears of a child, he calls to mind that they
are the persons from whom he has received his origin, his
support, and education. If he has derived his origin, οἰ·
his bodily existence from them, then he ought by the law
of nature to be subject to them: If his food and suste-
nanoe, then he is bound to it by the moral debt of grati-
tude orjustice. Lastly, if his instruction and discipline,
then he is constrained to yield this obedience on account
of his own advantage.

3. Contumely is fixed upon God himself, when parents
are not honoured ε for whatever parents are, they have the
likeness of God, who is the supreme Father, and from
whom all paternity is derived. O] Him is tlte wholefamzly
in heaven and ραν-ἰὴ, Ephes. iii. 15. Hence Lactantius,
Instit. lib. 5. cap. 19, calls God himself, our true and su-
preme Fatlzer; but he also adds, and earthly parents are
instrumentis of oar existence under God. These subordinate
parents ,therefore, cannot be contemned, without God also
,being contemned.

4. They who strive at pleasing their parents, the same
