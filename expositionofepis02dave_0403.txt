Clzap. iii. ANSWERS To OBJECTloNs. 3953

hibited to all an infallible proof of the highest love; but
there are no different degrees in that which is the highest.
Lastly, if Christ so died for all that by his death he pro-
cured for those who were not elected only the possibility
of salvation under the condition of faith, or a remedy only
applicable‚ which he knew would not be applied, but for
the elect the application itself aud salvation; he may seem
to have loved those more who were not elected than the
elect, because it shews greater love to suffer death for any
one in order to acquire for him a small than a great good ; as
he would shew a more ardent love for any one who should
expose himself to death lest another should be hurt only a
very little, than if he should do it lest he should be capi-

REPLY 14. The object of both these passages of Scrip-
ture is the same3 namely, to kindle in Christians a mutual
and most tender love from the example of our Saviour
Jesus Christ, who so far loved us as to endure death, for

exhibited it towards us by laying down his life for us, we
ought also, where there is need, to lay down our lives for
the brethren, as it is in the aforesaid place, l John iii. 16.
Therefore‚ it is not enough that we should be ready to ex-

gers for the brethren, because there is a much greater love,
that is, a greater, more certain, and clearer proof of our
love, namely, that we should lay down our life for thern.
And because there is nothing dearer to any one than him-
self, therefore there is no greater testimony of love than
this, that any one should give himself up for his friend.
Now Ι come nearer to the solution and say, Although
we confess that no one has greater love, that is, can mani-
fest on his own part a greater external effect of his love,
than in laying down his life, because no one has any thing
more precious than his life3 yet, we deny that it can be
rightly deduced from hence, that the love of a person in
dying· for some others, is absolutely, simply, and in every
