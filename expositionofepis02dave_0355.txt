only to those who were willing to take it, he would in
reality not only make the beneficence of the king appear
less illustrious, but affirm what was evidently false. For
medical assistance was offered to all, without any previous
condition on the part os the person sent, or of the sick3
healing medicine applicable to all without exception was
provided. The willingness to receive the physician and
take the medicine had no connexion with the intention of
the Sovereign in sending the medical assistance, but with
the certain restoration of health.

The antient Fathers seem to have been much pleased
with this similitude. Prosper has respect to it, when Vin-
centius objected. That according to the opinion ofAugzcstine,
our Lord Jesus Christ did noc suſj'erfor tlte salvation and re-

Hebrews ii. Thac he by the grace of God should taste deatlz

hut that the world through him might be saved. He that be·
lieveclz in lzirn is not condemned,· bnt lie that believetlc not is
condemned already, because lze ΙιαιΙι not believed z'n tlze nanzecff
the only begotten Son of God. Let us annex to these words
those of John xii. 47, 48, If any man lzear my words and
believe not, Ijudge him not, for Ι carne not tojndge the world
but to save tlze world. He that rejecletlz me and receiveth not
my words, lzatlz one tlzatjzcdgetlz Ιιιίη,· the word that I lzave
spoken, the same slzall jnclge himin tlze last day. In these
words we learn that the Son of God was sent by the
