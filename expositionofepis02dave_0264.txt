254 ΑΝ εΧΡοειτιοΝ OF ST. PAUL’S Chap. iv.

power. WHEN THE LAND sHALL BE G1VEN1NTO YOUR
Powmz, ΥΕ sHALL DESTROY 'ruem ALTARs. Where the
power is not gii-en us, με shall not (lo it. For we do it before
we havethrown down the idols in their hearts. Therefore,
God requires this from them who are under the power of
idolaters, namely, that they should not pollute themselves
with the superstitious worship of the idols; but he does
not require, that they should attempt to hinder or abolish
their idolatry by external force. Ye s'holl see in Babylon
gods of silver, and of gold, and os wood borne upon shoulders.
Beware therefore that γε be z'n no wise like to strangers, nei-
ther be με afraid of them, when με see the multitude infore
them ancl behind them, worshipping them: but say yse in your
bearis, Ο Lord, we must worship thee. Baruch vi. 4, &Q in
that Epistle. which is attributed to Jeremy. Finally, Iadd
the example of Paul3 who, when he walked among the
numerous idols of Athens, did not attempt to pull them
down with his hands, or to shatter them with hammers,
but with reason and argument. See Acts xvii. 16, &Q to
the end.

4. The last business of wisdom is, not to refuse even to
unbelievers and pagans, the obedience due to them, whe-
ther by Divine or human right. Christ commanded this to
all his disciples, Matt. xxii. 21, Render unto Caesar the
things which are Caesar's, ond unto God the things that are

rious, feafless, and bloody set of men, composed of the rough and savage
populace, who embraced the party of the Donatists‚ maintained their cause
by the force of armS, and overrunning all Africa, filled that province with
slaughter and rapine, and committed the most enormous acis of perfidy and
cruelty against the followers of Caecilianus. This outrageous multitude,
whom no prospect of sufferings could terrify, and who, upon urgent occa-
sions, faced death itself with the most audacious temerity, contributed to
render the sect of the Donatists an object of the utmost abhorrence3 though
it cannot be made appear, from any records of undoubted authority, that
the bishops of that faction, those, at least, who had any reputation for
piety and virtue, either approved the proceedings, or stirred up the vio-
lence of this odious rabble.” Africa was the theatre of the most bloody
soenes, owing to the excesses of these wretches during a great part of Con-
stantine's life. For a further account of the Circumcelliones the learned
