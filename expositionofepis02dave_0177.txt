with the husband of all his goods: It is therefore injustice
if he consume on himself more than his circumstances al-
low, and in the mean time withdraws from his wife what is
just and good. This is esteeined bitterness in the doer,
and it necessarily savours of bitterness to the sufferer: For
all persons deprived of their proper privileges are deeply grieved,
says Aristotle, OEconom. i. cap. 8.

Lastly. It is the height of this bitter tyranny, to act
cruelly towards the wife by stripes or blows3 which we do
not read that any one among the heathen did, unless he
was drunk or mad. Hence the civil law permits the wife
to αυαὶἷ herself of a divorce, if slze can prove that lzer husband
has beaten lter: and it gives as a reason, that blows are Jo-

and in Novell. constit. 117. For no superiority whatever
gives the power of coercing the inferior by blows. If two
persons enter into a league of friendship on the condition
that the younger shall obey the elder, and be directed in
all things by his vvisdom and discreti0n; he is bound to
obedience by virtue of this contract: but if he refuse to
do that, he cannot be forced to his duty by blows. The
same must be said with regard to the matrimonial con-
tract: for in this the husband and wife agree to a certain
amicable fellowship in life, so that the wife is to be sub-
ject to her husband, and directed by him3 butas a com-
panion‚ not as a slave3 by advice, not by stripes.’³'⁵

Aristotle gives this reason ; because it is not fic lo z‘ustil
such sear into the wffe, wlziclz may be irgjztrious botlz to respect
(md love: but that servile sear which is instilled by blows is
subversive of both.

Neither is it fit that any one should exercise power over
another by constraint supported by no law3 but that power

⁴⁸⁹ It is one of the glories of Christianity that it gave woman her proper
place in society. Under the Jewish dispensatim, woman was perpetually
reminded that she was first in the transgression. In republican Athens,
man was every thing, and woman nothing. In most heathen countries she
is little more than a slave. It is in Christian nations she has been raised to
an equality with inan. lt is Christianity that has conferred upon her liberty

and heaven.
