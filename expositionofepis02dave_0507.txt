of Christ being admitted, the goodness, wisdom, and jus-
tice of God required that it should be supplied to all men
individually. Nor shall we quote only certain individual
Fathers, but produce a few testimonies from those who
were engaged with the Pelagians and Semipelagians. But
I premise one thing worthy of observation‚ When we say
that the orthodox Fathers who opposed Pelagius and the
Pelagians, admit that grace is given to all men, out of re-
gard to the death of Christ, the word grace is not to be
extended beyond its proper limits (as the Pelagians for-
merly extended it). For whatever is graciously granted by
God to men, may in some sense be called grace. Thus the
light of nature with which God iiluininates every man that
comes into the world3 that testimony of things created, by·
which the heathen are directed to some knowledge of the
Creator3 those external benefits by which God testifies his
philanthropy towards the whole world 3 those internal -mo-
tions with which he sometimes affects the minds of hea-
thens, so as to restrain them from any evil work, or to ex-
cite them to any good work, may in this large sense claim
the name of grace. The Pelagians concealed the poison
of their pestilential doctrine under this general notion of
grace. But neither do the Scriptures so understand the
grace given by Christ, nor the holy Fathers, who, after the
rise of Pelagius, learnt to speak more cautiously. Under
the name of tlte grace of Christ, or Saving grace, received
in the sense of the Scriptures, those benefits and superna-
tural gifts alone are meant, which are directly ordained for
obtaining salvation through Christ, but not infallibly ε such
as the preaching of the Gospe13 the illumination of the
minds of men in the mysteries of the saith, and, in one
word, whatever supernaturally tends to unite men to Christ
and place them in a state'of salvation, yet does not of
itself unite them to him, or translate them from a state of
death to a state of salvation. This preaching and know-
ledge of the Gospel the Apostle has designated by the
name ofgrace, (l Cor. i. 4, and ii. ll), and hence it is that
St. Peter (l Epist. iv. 10) calls preachers stewards of the
manifolcl grace of God. So Augustine calls the Gospel
