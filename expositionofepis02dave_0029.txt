nor the members of his body as instruments of iniquity
thereto, is accounted dead to sin.

3. The Apostle requires that we should duly hold the
my stery of oui baptism, and transfer it to the use of piety
and holiness. For he derives this most beautiful exhorta-
tion‚ Seelc not the tlze’ngs that are on earth, because με are
dead, from the consideration of baptism, as it will appear
to those who look back to the 12th verse of the foregoing
Chapter. So in Rom. vi. 3, Know με not that as many ο] us

by the remains of sin, oppressed by various sorrows, and
at length fall under death: How, therefore, can it be true,
that they are risen with Christ and follow a new life‘?

The Apostle answers, that this new life is, in fact, only
begun, and is imperfect and obscure in the faithful them-
