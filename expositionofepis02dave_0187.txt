thy country, and from thy lcindred‚ and fiam thy father-'s
house, anto a land that Ῑ will shero thee. Therefore itis law-
ful to leave parents against their will, and to enter a mo-
nastery.

Iansiver, In no respect does it meet the case. Abraham
was now married, and his own master, not under the pro-
tection of his father3 Abraham had a special command3
it does not appear that Abraham's parents opposed him,
nay, it appears, Gen. xi. 31, that his father consented to
his journey3 not, indeed, to enter a monastery, but to go
into the land promised by God z But we contend respect-
ing children still living under the paternal care, who have
not a special command from God, and yet forsake their
parents against their will, and betake themselves to a mo-
nastery. The cases are altogether dissimilar· ¹

2. From Deut. xxxiii. 9, Who said unto hisfather and to
his mother, Ilcnowyoa not,- and to his brethren, I am iguo-

I answer3 The former passage speaks of the Levites,xvho
drew the sword at the command of God against the idola-
ἵετε, without any distinction of relationship, as you may
see in Exod. xxxii. It therefore proves no more, than that
they vvere worthy of commendation, who, to preserve the
worship of God, and execute the command of God, had
respect neither to relative, nor any human concern. What
has this to do with those, who against the command to
honour their parentS‚ fursake them, that they may practise
a superstitious worship in monasteries? That other pas-
sage does not say, He thal lovethjalher or mother more than
cloister or hood, but more than Christ: therefore it makes
nothing to the point. If we cannot obey Christ and pa-
rents, then we must fou-sake parents : but lawful obedience
is not opposed to religion, but is a religious work, and
pleasing to God.

3. From Psalm xlv. 10, Forget thzs peqale, and thy sa-
