chief fountain. The Apostle unites each cause, both pri—
mary and instrumental, in Rom. vi. 23, The gvj? of God is

In conclusion,

1. We are hence taught, as often as we perceive spiri-
tual grace languish within us, to seek a fresh supply from
Christ, in whom is hid the fountain of spiritual life.

2. Hence it is seen how necessary it is to be united with
Christ by saith and the Spirit: for if we are separated
from him, we are not Christians, but the dead carcases of

The Apostle proceeds still further to shew that earthly
things are not to be sought or savoured by Christians, but
heavenly ones. He derives his argument from the expec-
tation of the glory destined for us. We shall consider
