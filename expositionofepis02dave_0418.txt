So far their opinion. Ι deny that this sufficiency of the
death of Christ for reconciling all men can be rightly con-
ceived from the mere sufficiency of the thing offered,
unless there be added the ordained sufficiency from the act
of offering. Which may be proved thus:

ARGUMENT lst. When we say that Christ died suffi-
ciently for all men, we say nothing else than that he was
offered up sufficiently for all men, or that he gave himself
as a ransom or price of redemption sufficiently for all men.
But to die for all, or to be offered upfor all, or to give him-
selfsor all, designates the act of dying, or of offering up
himself to deliver all, completed by some ordination.
Therefore, the sufficiency of the ransom alone, without the
intention and act of offering accomplished as to the per-
sons, cannot make this assertion true. Christ died stffi-
cientlyfor all. But common sense refuses that it should
be granted that he died sufficiently for all, who is denied
to have died or to have been offered up sor some. But
granting the intrinsic sufficiency of the ransom to redeem
3 thousand worlds, at the same time it must be granted
that this same ransom is not yet offered in any way for
many men, nor yet offered up sufficiently. For as ten
thousand pounds are enough, and more than sufficient to
liberate five debtors, who each owe two hundred pounds3
yet if this entire sum should be offered and paid to the
creditor for two only by name, the other three being ex-
cluded, the sufficiency and superabundance of this ran-
som in itself will not effect, that it may be said to be given
and paid sufficiently for those three t thus, in this common
cause of the human race, although the precious blood of
Christ be a ransom more than sufficient for blotting out
the debts of every individual‚ yet it cannot be from thence
inferred that he was sufficiently offered for them, who, in
the very act of offering, are openly excluded. Tlieresore,
