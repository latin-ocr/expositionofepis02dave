Ver. 2. EPISTLE To THE conossmns. 233

conveniences arose from thence in the antient church3
where the women were debarred from these vigils‚ because
that under the eloak of prayer, they committed secret
wickedness. And the abuses at the vigils of the martyrs
which h‘ad almost been the usage and the law, are censured
in Augustine. See De n10rib.eccles. cathol. cap. 34. epist.
64, and in many places in his Sermons.

Now as to the devotion of private persons, who, not
being content with daily prayer, even watch in the night3
it is indeed truly laudable, if it be destitute of supersti-
tion, and arises out of zeal for the Divine name, and
finally be employed when there seems great and just cause
to exact this vigilance. David, yea Christ himself, fur-
nishes us with an example for this watchfulness, Matt.
xxvi. 38, 39. Paul also imitates his Master in this matter, '
2 Cor. vi. 5. Nor are these vigils only laudable, but they
are also delightful to the pious ; as Augustine truly says,
De bono viduit. cap. 21, Vigils in as far as they do not in·
jure the healch, if spent in praying, singing, or reading, are
converted into spiritual pleasures.

Hitherto we have spoken concerning vigils properly so
called. lt remains that we treat those so termed metapho-
rically and figuratively, that is, the vigils of the mind3
which are. plainly necessary, not only in our prayers, but
in our whole life, and therefore ought to be perpetual·
Now Ι say that the mind is vigilant or watchful, when no
ways asleep in sin and worldly things3 but always lively
expects the day of death and the coming of Christ, and
tastes beforehand‚ as it were, future glory in hope and a
sure faith- He who keeps his mind prepared in this man—

referred to by our Expositor is given in these words :—“ We have thought
fit to hinder women from spending the night in the Cemeteries‚ because
oftentimes under pretence of praying they commit in secret great crimes.”
This Council has been mostly celebrated for condemning all use whatever of
pictures in Churches ; a decisive proof in itself, if proof were wanting, that
the use of images was then unknown in the Christian Church. “ lVe
would not‚'' says the 36th Canon, ‘⁶ have pictures placed in Churches, that
the object of our worship and adoration should not be painted on 'the walls.''
The 34th Canon prohibited also the use of lighted candles in the Cemeteriet
of the dead, that the spirits os the saints might not be disturbcd.
