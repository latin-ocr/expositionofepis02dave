Seez'ng that με leave put off the old man with his deeds.] The
Apostle here comes to the first argument of the aforesaid
dissuasion. He derives it from the removal of the cause
to the removal of the effects. For the old man is the cause
of the vices before-mentioned3 when he, therefore, is put
off, they must be put off also.

lee old man denotes the corruption inherent in our na-
ture, the inclination of all our faculties to evi13 and, more-
over, that state of sinfulness which they acquired by the
habit of sinning before their ingrafting into Christ. The

⁴⁸* The doctrine of the Church of Rome, concerning Equivocations‚ men-
tal Reservafions, and the Lawsulness, or rather Obligation‚ of concealing,
with the most solemn Oaths, what has been revealed under the seal of
Confession‚ has perhaps some affinity with the doctrine of the Priscillian-
ists, which overspread and disturbed Europe in the fifth Century-a sect
which inculcated on their Proselytes the dreadful maxim, “ Sweao-‚fm-swear,
but never betray a secret‚’' and by which Cassian, as noticed at the outset of
this topic, would seem to have been corrupted. The defence set up by the
Romish divines for such a notion is, “ That what is only known under the
Seal of Confession, is not known to a man, but to God represented by a
man, i. e. to the Priest or Confessor3 and therefore the Priest may, with a
safe Conscience, affirm, even upon oath, that he knows not what lie thus
knows. It is by recurring to this doctrine, that F. Daniel Bai-toli, in his
History of England, or rather of the Jesuits in England, endeavours to
justify the conduct of the Jesuit Garnet, in not discovering the Gunpowder
plot, to which he supposes him to have been pr1vy. But as it was disclosed
to him in confession, or at least under the seal of confession, he would have
sinned grievously by discovering it, though by such a discovery he might
have saved a whole nation from destruction. So that the violating such a
Seal is a far greater evil than the loss of so many lives—than the utter ruin
of an entire Nation :''--a doctrine evidently repugnant to the dictates both
of reason and humansty, horrible in its own nature, and awfully danger-
ous in its consequences wherever it is heht—Vide Bower, Vol, i. p. 150.
