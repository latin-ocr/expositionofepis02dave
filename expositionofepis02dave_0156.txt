146 AN EXPOSlTION or ST. PAUL’S Chap.iii.

Do all things in the nanze ff the Lord J esus Christ] That
{is said to be done in the name of Christ, which is done
l through his assistance, according to his command and will,

and for the promotion of his glory. All these things the
Scripture is wont to comprise in this form of speaking,
and the Apostle in this passage seems to have wished to
comprise them all. For so this phrase is every where em-
ployed, as well in the Old as in the New Testainent. Thus
Psal. xliv· 6, In thy name will 'zoe tread under our enemies:
that is, by thy help. Psal. xxxi. 3, For thy vame's salse
lead me, Sto. that is, for thy glory. Luke x. 17, The devils
are suhject unto thy namen that is, by thy invocation3 by
thy aid. Matt. xviii. 20, Where two or three are gothered to-
gether z‘n my name: that is, by my command, imploring my
help, for my sake, to advance my doctrine and glory.
You see what it is to clo all things in the name of Christ:
Now it remains, that we briefly shew, that all things are
to be thus done in the name of Christ.

As to good actions which are done immediately in refer-
ence to God and our salvation3 it is certain, that nothing
can either be done, or said, or thought, that is good by
us, unless it be done in the name of Christ, that ig, accord-
ing to the will of Christ, and by the assistance and invo-
cation of Christ, and for the glory of Christ. I can do all
things, says the Apostle‚ through Christ who strengtheneth
me, Phil. iv. 3, We are not sufficient of ourselves to think any
thing as of ourselves, 2 Cor. iii. 5. Mos't truly said Augus-
tine‚ Soliloq‚ cap. 24, 25, It is not of man to wish what he
can, or to (ffict what he may wiSh, or to know what he would
wish or would do ,· huc the ways (ῃι man are directed by God.
Now God governs us by Christ: we ought therefore to do
all things relying upon the grace and assistance of Christ
the Mediator.

This likewise is evident, That all our good actions must
be referred to the glory of Christ. For if they are done
with any other end, although they may seem good as to
the externa! appearance, yet they become bad on account
of the perverse intent: For the end determines the quality in
morals, say the schoolmen. Hence John, Revel, v. 13,
