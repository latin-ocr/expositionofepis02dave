28 AN exrosmwou or ST. PAUL'S Chap. iii.

Thirdly, the circumstances of the time in which we ex—
pect this glorious life is a most powerful inducement to
withdraw our minds from the. love of earthly things. For
when shall this crown of glory be given‘.l leen he shall
appear, i. e. on the day of the coming of the Lord. Now
this day, if we believe the Scriptures, will come both
quickly and suddenly.

Quickly3 Yet a little while, and he that shall come, will
come, and will not tarny, Heb. x. 37. And Rev. xxii. 12,
Behold I come quichly, ancl my reward is with me. It ought
not, then, to seem troublesome or burdensome to regulate
the short period of our time, and to abstain from earthly
things, when Christ is at hand, and promises us eternal
glory. The hirelz'ng, because he ponders l'zeavily his drudgery,
thinks lig-hely of the reward, says Gregory, Moral, 8. 8. Be
patient, therefore, and stablish your hearts, for the coming ‘ff
the Lord draweth, mgb, Jas. v. 8.

That day shall likewise come suddenly z As the light shin-
ethfrom heaven, so shall the Son of „Man be in his day, Luke
xvii. 24. The day of the Lord will come as a tlzz'ef, 2 Pet.
iii. 10. Now then who does not see how dangerous it is to
be involved in earthly things and desires, and so to be taken
unawares? Christ foresees this our danger, and forewarns
us to avoid it; Be wse like anto men that waitfor their Lord
when lze will return from tlze wedding, διο. Luke xii. 36.
Behold Ι come as a tlzz'cff. Blessed is he that watcheth‚ and
keepeth his garments, lest he wall.- valced, and they see his
shame, Rev. xvi. 15. What, then, will become of us, if
we are taken unawares immersed in all these earthly things ‘3
Hear Greg0ry3 He who would not go with the stream, let him
avoid the torrent ; lest by that which allures him, he be cat ried

to that which he avoids: for he is drawn to the same point to
which he inclines, Moral 22. 2.

And thus it has been briefly shewn, that whether we
consider the gift itself of eternal glory, or the giver‚ or the
time of giving, all and every one of these considerations
ought to withdraw us from the love of earthly things, and
excite us constantly to seek and to meditate on heavenly
things. lt now remains that from the whole we deduce
