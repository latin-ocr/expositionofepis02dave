Chuni. ox THE omum or Tnss CONTROVERSY. 323

Augustffie, as it appears hythe fifth canon. From these
things it is evident, that although the seeds of this con-
troversy were sown, yet that Augustine and his disciples
would never be the patrous of the doctrine, That Christ
szfferedfbr the predestinated alone. But dismissing Augus-
tine let us come to Pelagius and his followers. And here
it is worth while to observe, that in the late discussions of
this controversy, two errors contrary to each other have
been attributed to Pelagius, but falsely. For those who
contend that Christ died for the elect alone, say that the
opposite opinion, namely, That Christ died for als, is one
of the pelagian errors. On the contrary, those who are
on the opposite side, exclaim, that it is mere Pelagianism
to say, That Christ diclnoc die for all men. But they do
injustice to both sides, to Pelagius and to themselves.
With respect to the first, a certain learned man says, that
this opinion concerning universal redemption and limited
deliveranee‚ was attributed to the Pelagians aud Semipela-
gians; and supported by a certain passage of Augustine
against Julian (lib. 3. cap. 3.) where he attacks the Pelas-⁸
gians in this manner, Go on still, go (nm (md as you say, Ιιι
the sacrament of the Saviour insanis are baptised, bnt are not
saved,· are redecmed, but are not liberated ; are washed, bnt
are not absolved,· so also say, Blood is shed jor them for the
remissiore qf' sins, but they are not cleansed by the remission of
sin. These are marvellous things which you say, they are new
things which you say, tlzezs arefalsc things which you say, and
so on. But in this place Augustine disputes about infants
only3 nor does he do this in order to shew that it is to be
set down as pelagianism, That Christ died for those who
on account of their own unbelief are not saved, but that
He died for those, or redeemed those who were not subject
to sin, and therefore had no guilt from which they should
be freed. For as it respects infants, Pelagius acknow-
ledged in words that they were redeemed, but taught in
reality that they had no need of redemption; as it is evi-
dent, since he contended, That there was nothing depraved im
them, nothing held under the power ofthe dcvi& in one word,
nothing which could be recleemed by so great a price. (August,
vor„ 11. Y
