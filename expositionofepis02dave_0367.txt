3. Whoever from the ordination of God may be called
to believe in the Mediator, and they who by believing may
obtain eternal life, to them the death of Christ from the
previous ordination of God is applicable for salvation:
But every livin'g person may be called to believe in the
Mediator, and by believing, according to the evangelical
covenant, may obtain eternal life: Therefore, the death of
Christ is applicable to every living person. The connexion
of the major appears from hence, that a real call to be-
lieve presupposes an object prepared in which to believe,
and this very possibility of being saved hy believing implies
a saving object, that is, That the death or merit of Christ
was ordained as a remedy applicable to him to whom such
a benefit is promised under the condition of faith. For if
he should be called to saith in Christ to whom Christ was,
not applicable from the ordination of God, saith would be
required in a false object, or rather in none at all as to the
¹person called. For it would be the same as if the preach-
er of the Gospel should call upon a devil in human form,
and living among men, to believe in Christ, and should
promise eternal life to him, if he would believe. Such a
call would be erroneous on the part of the person calling,
and useless on the part of the called3 because he is called
to believe in Christ, to whom Christ from the ordination of
God is not applicable3 and salvation is promised to him
under acondition‚ to whom, although he should be sup-
posed to believe, salvation would nevertheless be denied
on account of a defect of the sacrifice and covenant per-
taining to him. This is not the case with any living per-
son3 therefore it must be confessed that the death of
Christ is applicable to every one under the conditions of
the evangelical covenant. The major being proved, Ι pass
to the minor, which ought to be incontrovertible among
all the orthodox. For although the providence of God
does not procure that every individual should know the·
Gospel, and so that all should be called to Christ3 yet
God himself has appointed that the Gospel should be a
thing really to be announced to all. (io andpreacla {0 every
