Ver. 5. EPlSTLE To THE COLossrANS. 37

From the object3 members,

5. This body of sin is as natural to every one of us, as
is the very body of our flesh3 nor does it consist of fewer
members than that other.

6. As whilst we live here we necessarily carry about
this natural body, nor are able to put it off3 so neither can
we entirely lay aside this body of sin, which cleaves to us,
although we can and ought to chasten and subdue it.
There is, therefore, a perpetual, laborious‚ and dangerous
warfare to the Christian: perpetual, because with an ene-
my not to be extirpated in this life 3 laborious‚ because with
a manifold enemy3 dangemus, because with an internal
enemy.

7. Original sin is not to be placed in a mere privation
or withdrawal of original righteousness, as certain of the
Schoolmen dream3 but, furthermore, in many depraved and
corrupted dispositions, habits, and affections. parisiensis·
hath learnedly proved this opinion in lib. De vitiis et pec-
catis, cap. 5and 6. Thomas, l. 2. qu. 82. art. l, assents
to this, whose words I shall annex: We must assert, that as
bodily sz'clcrzess partly consists in privatim, as far as the equalz'ty
(ff healtlz is taken away ; and partly in positive irfiictz'on, the
humours themselves being disordered .· so also original sin con—
sists in tlte privation <ff original righteousness ; and, together
with tlzis, in tlte disorder (ff thesaculties <ff tlte soul .· where-
sore, it is nota mere privation, but a certain corrupt habit.
Thus speaks Thomas. Neither is it probable that these
words which are used by the Apostle, tlze old Adam, tlte
body ofsin, earthly member-s, intend nothing else than mere
privation.

From the epithets, your, and earthly,

8. Original sin hath its origin, neither from God our
Creator, nor from the principles of our pure and upright
nature, but from the voluntary sin of our first parents.
Hence our members are called parts of it, i. e. of the old
Adam, propagated to us, and dwelling in us.

9. If there be any thing good in us, that ought to be
referred to God alone; for What ltast thou wlziclt thou least
not received? If we would arrogate any thing to ourselves
