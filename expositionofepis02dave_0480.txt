470 Α DissERTATmN os THE DEA‘rH or cunis-r.

Thus Junius remarks on these words, He says that the grace
was given from eternity‚ to which we were predestinatcd from
elerm'ty. Nor has Calvin otherwise expounded them 3 This
gffc of grace, says he, eff whiclz the Aposlle makes mention, is
nothing else than predestinatwn, by which we ore adopted
among the sons of God. A little after, He gave tlzot which,
without being indue-ed by merit, he assigned to those who were
not-yet born, and he had it [αἰά- up in his mensures, until lze
should really manifest that lze had appointed nothing iu. vain.
Therefore we rightly deduce from hence, that the grace of
justification, reconciliatmn, aud salvation were actually
assigned from eternity to all the elect, and, as it were, laid
up and reserved for them in the treasury of the Divine love ;
but it is not rightly deduced that they were actually con-
ferred upon them before saith and conversiom The justifi-
cation and reconciliation of the elect is not said to be
opened aud manifested when they believe in Christ, but
then given and conferred. But what is said to be then re-
vealed and manifested, is the eternal good pleasure or pur-
pose of God concerning the salvation of the elect3 which
he makes known to us when, the spirit and saith having
been given, we obtain justificatior} and reconciliation with
God.

There are some other passages brought forward to prove
that our reconciliation with God is not effected at the time
when we enibrace the Mediator by saith, but that all the
elect vvere reconciled to God from eternity. Of this kind
are Rom. v. 10, When we were euemies, we were reconciled to
God by the deallz of lzis Son. Ephes. ii. 4, 5, For his great
love wlierewitlz lle loz-ed us, even when we were dead in sins,
Izatlz ‹suiclsened us together witlz Christ. And Coloss. i. 21,
22, Andyou, tlzat were sometime alienated and enemies itzyour
mind by wicked mortes, yet now lzotk he reconciled in tlze body
of hisfleslz through death, &Q From these passages it ap-
pears that reconciliation does not follow the act of saith,
but that God is reconciled to his own, even when they are
unbelievers and enemies to God. For it is not a proof of
God being placable and reconcileable, but of his being pa-

cified and actually reconciled, when such beuefits are con-
ferred upon men·
