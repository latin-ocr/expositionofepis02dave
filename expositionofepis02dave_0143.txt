But the contrary opinion (which is ours, and the same as
the Apostles) we shall shew can be confirmed, the sources
of our argument being indicated,

1. From the command of God, who commands the
study of the Scriptures not only to the clergy but to the
people, and so to all who live in the Chur0h3 Deut· xi.

18, 19.

2. From the intention of God; who would have the
doctrine of salvation to be delivered in writing, to the in-
tent that it might be accessible to all, John xx. 31, and
Rom. xv. 4.

ciety a ‘⁶ most crafty device, by which the very foundations of religion are
undermined,'' a ‘⁶ pestilence,” and “ defiiement of the faith, most immi-
nently ‹langerous to souls.” Leo XII. in 1824, speaking of the same insti-
tution‚ says that it “ strolls with effrontery throughout the world, con-
“ temning the traditions of the holy Fathers, and, contrary to the well
“ known Decree (ψ tlze Couneil qf Trent, labours with all its might, and by
“ every means, to translate, or rather to pervert, the Holy Bible into the
“ vulgar languages of every nation ς from which proceeding it is greatly to
“ be seared, that what is ascertained to have happened to some passageS,
“ may also occur with regard to others; to wit, that by a perverse interpre-
“ tation, the gospelof Christ be turned into a human gospel, or what is
“ still worse, into the gospel of the devil.” The Irish Roman Catholic
prelates, to whom this was written, public-ly nvowed their full concurrence
with the Pope's views, and charged their flocks to surrender to the Parish
priests all copies of the Scriptures received from Bible Societies, as well as
all publications disseminated by the Religious Tract Society. See the En-
cyclical Letter of Pope Leo the XlIth. pp. 16, 54-57. See also Cramp's
Text Book of Popery, Chap. ὃς a work which ought to be in the hands of
every Protestant, especially of every Protestant Minister, in the present

of the Author-John Molanus‚ to whom our Expositor refers on the
point under consideration, little is recorded, although he was a voluminous
writer. He was a Professor of Theology who flourished in the sixteenth
Century at Louvain, dying in 1585, at the age of 52. He commenced his
authorship by critical Notes upon the Martyrology of Usuardus, which was
published at Louvain, in 1568, and soon went through seven editions. Du
Pin enumerates 13 volumes or pieces of his; the one alluded to above by
Davenant, being his last, and published the year of his decease. He was
appointed Censor of Books by the Pope and the King, so that it is evident
his abilities and exertions were in repute ι but some of his pieces, especially
his work De Imaginibus, prove him to have been, like many of [he Frena-li
writers of the Romish Church, almost a l'rotestant.
