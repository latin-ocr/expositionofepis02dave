that it cannot be that anis thing should he done by God, which
is notforelcnown by God. Thus the saying is true, but this
meaning is nothing to the purpose. But since some persons
so totally apply themselves to the contemplation of the
eternal. and secret will and foreknowledge of God, that
they admit hardly any thing else into their minds‚ we will
shew briefly, that neither the Scriptores, nor the fathers,
nor reason itself, permit that we should determine accord-
ing to these secret and eternal decrees of predestination,
what is possible or impossible with God according to his
ordinary power.

We will begin with the Scriptures3 which do not confine
the power of God according to the secret decrees of his
will, but extend it according to his infinite might, and ac-
cording to the rule revealed in the word. ‘(Matt. iii. 9‚).
God is able (ff these stoues to raise up children anto Abraham.
(Mark xz 27‚) With God all things arepossible. (Matt. xxvi.
53,) T lzz'nlcest thou not that Ι cannot now pra-y to my Faffler,
and he shall presentlis give me more than twelve legions of
angels? (Mark xiv· 360 All things are possible unio Thee,
talce away this cupfrom me. Thus also the Apostle speaks
of the rebellious Jews, God is able to graft them in again
(Rom. xi. 23.) And of any fallen man, Who arc thou that
jadgest another mmz’s servant? to his own Illaster he stondeth
orfalleth .- yea, he shall he holden up, for God is able to make
him stand (Rom. xiv. 4.) And lastly, of every living man
it is true, God z's able to malfe all grace almund toward him (2
Cor. ix. 8.) Ι mention no more; from these it appears suf-
ficiently‚ that we are not to judge of the power of God
from his secret decrees : for he did not decree of stones to
raise up children to Abraham, nor to deliver Christ from
the hands of the JewS, nor to raise up and make to stand
every fallen man, nor to shed the abundance of his grace
on every one ς yea, he decreed and foreknew that he would
not do all these things, which nevertheless (if we are wil-
ling to attend to the holy Scriptores), are not on that ac-
count to be esteemed impossible.

Augustine, on this opinion, The Omnipotent Wfll can do
many things which he neither wills nor cloes, urges the case of
