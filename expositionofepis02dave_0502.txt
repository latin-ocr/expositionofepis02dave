gratuitous and special mercy of God in giving to some
men both the light of the Gospel and saving grace. On
which Prosper appositely remarks (De vocat. Gent. lib. 2,
cap. 31,) There z's some part of the human race, which is led
by special benefits to eternal salvation. They altogether take
away this special mercy, who think that by the death of
Christ it was effected that God should offer the means of
saving grace to all, but should leave to the special free-
will of individuals whether they would' obey or resist of-
fered grace; so that if they oppose no obstacle, grace
should be given them, but if they do, they should be de-
prived of grace. For according to the opinion of these
persons, God did not shew any special mercy to Jacob or
Peter, which he did not shew to Esau orJudas3 but Jacob
and Peter applied to themselves, by some special opera-
tion, what Esau and Judas neglected to apply. This Faus-
tus of Rheis taught openly, (De lib. arbitr. lib. 1, cap. 10)
who denied the special dispensation of God concerning
the salvation of certain men3 which he learnt from Pela-
gius, as may be seen from Prosper, (Carm. de Ingratis. cap.
10.) But Augustine thought otherwise (De bono persever.
cap. 12) The Lord gives to whom lte will because he is merci-
ful; am] does not give to whom he will not, tlzat he may mulce
known the riches (gf lzis glory in the vessels (ff mercy.

Thirdly, According to our opinion it follows, that all
occasion of gloryiug is taken away from men, and the
glory of human salvation is wholly attributed to God,who
distinguishes one man from another, according to the say-
ing of the Apostle‚ (l Cor. iv. 7) Who maketh thee to dg‘ffer?
What hast thou that thou didst not receive? From whom, says
Augustine, butfrom him who maketlz thee to differjrom αηο-
ther, to whom he hatlz not given what he bath given to thee?
(De praed. Sanct. capi 9.) But if the opinion of those
should be adopted, who think that by the death of Christ
God is made equally benevolent towards all men, and con-
tend that from this equal inclination towards all nien, he so
administers his grace, that whosoever makes a good use of
the light of nature, or does what he can of himself, at-
tracts this grace to himself, and he who makes a bad use
