284 AN EXPOSlTloN OF ετ, ΡΑυιέ Chap. iv.

Jesus wlzo is calledJuscasi] It is likely that he was the
person who welcomed Paul into his house at Corinth, when
he was rejected by the other blaspheniing Jews. For thus
Luke writes, Acts v. 5—7. When Paul preachecl that ²Iesus
was Christ, tlze Jews whiclz dwelt at Corinth opposed them-
selves, and blasplzemed; but he shoolc leis raiment, aml said
‘zmto them, Your blood be upon your own lceads ; and he enter-
ed iulo α certain man's house named Justus, one wlzo worship-
ped God, whose lzousejoz'ned hard to the synagogae.

This surname seems to have been assigned him, because
he had been always most observant of justice and equity.
We read that this same snrname was given to some others,
as to Janies Alphaeus, who is called Janies Justus3 cou-
cerning whom Eusebius has many things, lib. 2. cap. l,
and 23. This surname is also affixed to Barsabas, Acts
i. 23. As to this Jesus Justus3 there is neither any men-
tion made (that I recollect) elsewhere in the Sacred Scrip-
tures, nor does any thing occur in Eusebius3 unless this
be the same Justus whom he reckons third Bishop of Je-
rusalem, lib. 3. Hist. eccl. cap. 29. Thus much of the
person.

both this Justus and those two named above. And they
are commended from their nation, namely, that they were
sprung from Jewish parents3 which is marked by the ad·-
junct (ff tlze circumcision. And this so much the more con-
tributes to their praise, because the rest of the Jews for
the most part, as well at Rome, as in other places, were
most bitter enemies of the Apostles and of the Christian
religion: yea (as Justin Martyr, in his Dialogue with
Trypho, writes) T he Jews were they wlco every where stirred
up tlze lzeatlzen against the Clzrz'stians, witering the most odious
lies against us and our Religion. They, therefore, are here
deservedly praised, who not only had cast off this inward
malice of the Jewish race against Christ, but had put on
Christ himself, and promoted the Christian Religion to-
gether with Paul and the othei· believers.

Here observe3 Itis not always safe in the business of
Religion to follow the major part, or obstinately to retain
national opinions. For they who were of the circumcismn,
