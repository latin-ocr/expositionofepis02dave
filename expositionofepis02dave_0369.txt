Christ would profit him if he believed, we presume that it
was destined for him, as applicable before he believed.

4. If all men, as soon as the doctrine of the Gospel
concerning Christ the Redeemer enduring death on account
of the ‘sins of mankind, is made known to them, are
bound to be grateful and obedient to Christ, then it is cer-
tain that this work of the Redeemer in offex-ing himself as
a sacrifice to God, is to be considered as a benefit gene-
rally applicable to all; for there is no cause why we should
say that they are bound to ,egi-atitude, or to the duties of
obedience, on account of the death of Christ, who are al-
together excluded from that benefit: But an Apostle testi-
fies that every man may be excited to obedience by this
argument. For to all men, after this mystery of the death

build exhortations of this kind, will be always uncertain,
and often false: Always uncertain, because it cannot be

redemption are not bound to live to Christ, unless it be
presupposed that the sacrifice offered by Christ for the re-
demption of the world was for them. Moreover‚ Christ
could not claim for himself any supreme dominion ove-r
each and every man in right of his death, unless the merit.
of his death were, according to the ordination of God,
applicable to all for salvation. Since, then, To this end
Christ both died, and rose, and remed, that he might be Lord
both of the dead ancl living, Romans xiv. 9, we ought, to ex-
tend his death to all, at least as to the right and power of
a saving application; although the Spirit of Christ (who
bloweth where he listeth) gives to rnen the faculty and
