3. Hence we may infer the misery of the ungodly and
unbelieyers: who, as they are void of saith and the love
of God, cannot indeed pray‚ except for form's sake, much
less can they continue in prayer. But what is more miser-
able than he who cannot hold any commerce with the very
fou-ntain of blessedness?

4. Hence appears the happiness of the godly and faith-

an inexhaustible treasure, can never want any thing which

to nocturnal assemblies, when they would either preach
the gospel, or offer public prayers to God3 as is manifest
from Acts xii. 12, and xx. 7, and in other places. More-

when the Emperors were converted to the Christian reli-

retained the custom of' the vig-ils, and most especially ce—
lebrated them when the anniversary of the festivals ap-
proached. Hence the sermons of the Fathers upon the
vigils of the Nativity‚ the vigils of Easter: we also read
even now of the custom upon the vigils of the martyrs.
Now they spent these vig-ils in the word and prayers, and
prepared themselves beforchand in this, manner for the
