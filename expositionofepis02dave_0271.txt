Ver. 6. Eiusne το THE COLOSSIANS. 261

2. Alwayffi says the Apostle. Not that we must always
speak ς for there is a time to be silent : but that when we
speak, we must always take care to speak as we ought.

Here,⁴ therefore, they are to be reproved, who only speak
soberly and religiously before ministers or other grave men,
or when they suffer from disease 3 whilst in their banquets
οι· private conversations, they think they may make use,
as by a peculiar privilege, of any obscene or foolish expres-
sions.

3. Let it be with grace seasoned witlz sala] How our
speech is to be rightly regulated, is now, in the third
place, shewn; namely, if it be in a manner seasoned with
grace as with salt. Hence Tremellius translates the pas-
sage a little more freely, Let your speech be witlz grace, aud ἡ
as if it were seasoned with salt. ssy grace and salt in this
place we must understand that pious and religious pru-
dence flowing from the Holy spirit, which first directs the
heart, then the tongue of the man to utter speech as he
ought. This gift of grace is likened to salt on two ac-

counts:
l. Because as salt extracts the noxious humours from

meats‚ and banishes all putrescency from them: so the
grace of heavenly wisdom represses idle and useless lan-
guage in the discourse of the godly3 and it altogether re-
moves and takes away from them wicked, obscene, and
impure language. Let πο corrupt communication proceed
out os your mouth, διο. Ephes. iv. 29.

2. Because as salt not only dries up the superfluous and
noxious humours of meats, but makes them much more fit
to be digested, and wholesome for nutriment3 so the salt
of wisdom operates, not only that the discourse of Chris-
tians be not idle or noxious, but becomes more suited and
useful for edification. For what is said of Solomon,
Eccl. xii. 10, may be extended in a degree to all the godly,
He souglzt to find out acceptable words, ancl that which was
written was upriglzt, even words qf trzetlz.

Instructions.
1. No discourse of Christians ought to be insipid: but
