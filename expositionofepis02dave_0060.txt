50 AN EXPOslTloN OF ετ. PAUL’S Clmp.ii÷.

Julian, cap. 3, The lust of theflesh, against which the good
Spiric lusteth‚ is sin, because we yield obedieuce contrary to the
sway of reason. Lastly, let him hear his own Schoolmen:
Parisiensis says, We ought tofollow 'cuith the sword the peti-y
thieves of first, second, and third motions, that is, the thoughts,
desires, and delights which are beyond the control of reason, De
sacram. poenit. cap. 15. The whole host of the flesh which
wars against the Spirit is sitfful : therefore also all the battal-
lz'ons of that army .· wherefore both thefirst haltamma, which is
that (ff thefirst motz’ons ; arrd the second, which is the delights
beyond the control of reason, are sitfful. De sacram. matr.
cap. 7. We have also Aquinas in concurrence with us,

riches, and confiding in them as in its chief good. That
this insatiable thirst is the property of covetousness is
shewn in Eccles. v. 10, He that loveth silver shall not be satis-
fied with silver ; πον he that loveth abundauce with increase.
Now that the rich are wont to confide in their riches, and
to rest in them as their chief good, we see in the parable
of the rich man, which is contained in Luke xii. 19, I wilt
say unto my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid upformcmy
years, eat, drink, and be merry. The vice of covetousness
’πλεονεξιας is not the simple desire or seeking for temporal
goods ; but the doing it with an insatiable desire, by un-

in them. For temporal goods may be coveted in three
