and Christ, through the merit of his death, infallibly to
save some certain persons whom the Scripture marks by the
name of the elect3 and therefore, that, according to the
will of God, the death of Christ was, by some special
mode and counsel, offered and accepted for their redemp-
tion. Nor is it here necessary, for the defence of this spe-
cial counsel, to define that thorny question which has been
tossed about by many, and vexed all who have undertaken
to discussit, viz. Whellzer that decree was first, by wlziclz
certain persons are predestinated to tlze in allz‘ble parlz'cipation
(ff eternal life ,· ον tlte other, by which Christ was orclaz'ued to
his mediatorial office. For although, to sustain the weak-
ness of the human understanding‚ we are compelled to
conceive of some of the eternal decrees of God as prior
and some as posterior, yet it seems to me a slippery and '
very dangerous thing to contend about these imaginary
signs of our reason, as to undertake to establish and⁸ to
refute from them questions of faith. It ought, indeed, to
be placed beyond all doubt, that those decrees of God,
which are thought of by us according to the order of prior
and posterior, with respect to God himself consist of an
equable eternity of infinity3 neither can or ought any se-
parate moment to be granted, in which one decree having
been established, it can be rightly supposed, that the other
is not yet foreseen and established. Conceive, therefore,
that first in order was the decree of God concerning the
appointinent and sending of a Mediator (which seems to
ine more suited to our mode of understanding,) and that
afterwards was the decree. concerning the choice of certain
persons to the infrustrable attainment of eternal life through
the appointed Mediator; yet you can never so separate
these, as that the passion of the Mediator would not have
been foreseen from eternity‚ as offered in some special way
and regard for those persons who were to be chosen, and
accepted as if it were offered by God for them specially,
and that from eternity. On the other hand, conceive that
first in order was the decree concerning the electiori of cer-
tain persons to salvation 3 that afterwards was the decree
concerning the destination of Christ to the office of Me·
