226 ΑΝ ΕΧΡοειΤιοΝ or ST. PAUL'S Cleap. iv.

5. Because this ardent desire, upon the testimony of
Scripture, breaks forth in the prayers of all the saints.
Jacob by this effort of fervid prayer, when he wrestled with
God himself, came off conqueror, Gen. xxxii. 28. Moses
by this same tied up as it were the hand of God, nor suf-
fered him to destroy the rebellious Israelites. On account
of this earnestness, David every where calls prayer his cry.
In a word3 This intention and fervour has ever greatly
availed to the effectual obtaining of the object prayed for,
as the Apostle James testifies, v. l, the ffectual fervent
prayer of a righteous man avaz'letlz much. What is that fer-
vent prayer, ενεργουμενη δεησις, but prayer excited, actuated‚
and as it were quickened, by some influence of the spirit?

And thus much of the earnestneSS, or intention of mind,
which is required in the act itself of prayer, and intimated
by this word προσκαρτερεῖτε, continue or apply witlz all ραι-πεδί-
mess, m prayer.

But it is said, by this word προσκαρτερειτε is further inti-
mated the assiduity or frequency of this exercise3 which
ought to be such and so continual, that in that respect we
are commanded in the holy Scriptures to prag( always.
Christ himself teaches his disciples by a parable‚ tlzat we
ought always co prais, and not to faitel, Luke xviii. l. Pray
without ceasing, says the Apostle‚ 1 Thess. v. 17. Which
places are not to be taken in that sense, as though, leaving
and renouncing all other concernS, we should only be oc-
cupied in and cleave to prayer ε but as Augustine has
rightly observed, that charge, Pam WITHOUT cEAfflNG,
is to he received thus soberlgs, that certain seasons <ff prayer
should not be omitted in any day, De haeres. ad Quodvult-
deum, haer. 57. Psallianorum seu Euchitarum. For he is
deemed never to cease from his work, who works when he
can and ought. This perseverance·0f prayer then, does
not require an uninterrumed, but a frequently repeated act
of prayer: that is to say, we should not lay aside the de-
sire of prayer, either by the weariness of expectation, or
the despair of obtaining, or for any other cause whatever3
but we should invoke God frequently, and frequently plead
with him, even when he seems to have shut his ears to our

prayers. And this is the meaning of the Greek phrase.
