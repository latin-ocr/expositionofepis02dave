It is certain that neither the matter nor the form of lying
can be found in these3 and, therefore, they are wholly
void of all taint of sin. The matter is not found3 because-
falsehood is not uttered, but the truth expressed in a figu-
rative and customary manner3 for as the natural, so the
metaphorical signification of words depends upon custom
and the will of the speakers. Since, then, custom permits
us to call a cruel man α wolf or α lion, or a base or foun-
dation α rock: the proposition is the same, whether you
say a Heretic is α wolf, or a lzeretic is hostile aud z'tgy'urz‘ous to
tlzeflock of Christ.- that the devil is a roarz‘ng lz'0n; or the
devil seelcs soulsfor his prey .· Christ z's α roclc ; or Clzrist is
ilie base or foundation <ff human salvacion. The same reason-
ing applies to parables: For, as Augustine justly remarks,
De mend. ad Cous. cap. 5, Every proposition is to be referred·
to that wlziclz it sets forth ‚· but att tlzac is figurative& said or
done, sets fortlz that wliiclz it intimates to those by whom the
proposition is to be understood. Thus the Schoolmen. ¹ So
Aquinas, quaest. disp. de prophetia, art. 10, In metaphorical
language the lieet-at sense is attended to, and not what the me-
taphor expresses, but the meaning which is conveyed by the
metaphor. Durandus, lib. 3, dist. 38, says, A figurative
expression is not true or false according to tlte sense which it
conveJS, but to that which is intended. So Gerson, part. 1,
Ιη parables the literal sense is not tlzat expressed by tlte words,
bac that pointed out by tlze things or tlzefacls. But neither
is theform of lying found in these: for metaphors, para-
bles, aud apologues, are not used with the intention of (le-
ceiving, but with that of teaching with the greater elegance
and pleasure. For he who asserts that α lterelz'c is α wolf,
or the devil α rom-ing liam or he who puts forth a parable
or apologue, does not intend to impose any thing false upon
his hearers, but to represent more clearly something true,
and useful to be known.

4. In the last place, Let us glance at that Jesuitical
equivocation, which is defended, truly Ι know not whether
more ridiculously or impiously, by those master-builders
and patrous of lies. And first, we shall offer an example
of Jesuitical equivocation, or (as they term it) mental re-
