372 A DISSERTATION oN THE DEATH OF cnais‘r.

and merit of Christ is, according to the revealed will of
God, applicable to all men; and in this sense, that Christ
died for all rnen, but not for the apostate angels. But this
being assumed, we affirm nevertheless that God, who has
absolute authority over his own gift, is not bound to make
known, nor to apply this medicine to all mankind. So
Augustine says, leom he will not relieve, he does rzot relieve ;
of whom in lzz's predestination, he back otherwise determined,
secretly indeed, butjustly. For there is no 2'1‘1'11112'& with God,
but hisjudgments are inscrutable. Nor yet (as it was ob-
jected) will any one perish through ignorance alone of the
remedy. For in all that perish there will be found causes
why they perish, arising froin their own demerits, their
aforesaid ignorance accompanying only, not causing, their
perdition. ΤΙιοιι lta-§t destroyed thyself, Sto.

OBJECTloN 4. If the death of Christ is to be consi-
dered as a remedy or ransom applicable to every man, from
the ordination of God, then also the resurrection, inter-
cession‚ and mediation of Christ will have respect to all
men in the same manner. But Christ was not raised up
for all men, does not intercede for all, is not the mediator
of all: Therefore, neither is his death to be extended to
all. That these are never to be separated is proved from
Romans viii. 34, where they are all joined together. It is
Christ that died, yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even
at the right hand of God, who also mastreth intercessionsor us.
And Romans iv. 25, the Apostle teaches‚ that those for
whose offences Christ died, for their justification he was
raised again. But he was not raised again for all men;
Therefore, neither did he die for all.

REPLY 4. If the ground of our defence be rightly
weighed, it will easily appear that all these things are no
detriment to our cause. For we do not contend that the
death of Christ was, from the ordination os God, so ap-
plicable to each and every man, that on account of this
propitiatory sacrifice, all men are at once placed in a state
of grace and salvation3 nor do we defend this, that from
the special decree of God and of predestination, this death
of Christ is infallibly to be applied to each and every man3
