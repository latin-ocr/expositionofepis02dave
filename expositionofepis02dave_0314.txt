vers. 17.

And Say to Archippus, Talce heed to the ministry which thou
hast received in tlze Lord, that thoufulfil ic.

The Apostle adds a new command about admonishing
Archippus, to shew himself watchful and diligent in the
discharge of his ministry.

Say to Arclzz‘ppus.] Some think this Archippus was only
a deacon in the Church of Colosse3 conjecturing it perhaps
from hence, that in this place he is ordered tofuffil the mi-
nistr-y, την &anonam which, he had received. But this is weak:
For the words διακονος and δὶακονια are oftentimes taken for
any service in the Gospel, so that the office of the Apos-
tleship itself is called namma,- I magnifzs mine office την

διακονος, of Jesus Christ, l Tim. iv. 6. Whereof l was made
α minister, διακονος, Ephes. iii. 7. That, therefore, is more
true which Jerome writes in Epist. ad Philem. namely, that
this Archippus was either a bishop or at least α teacher in
the Church of Colosse. But now in the absence of Epa-
phras (who was his colleague in this evangelical office) he
must labour the more diligently therein‚ that he might
supply the place of both. But he (it is very likely) on
the contrary began to grow languid in his duty, and. there-
fore needed admonishing. Hence the Apostle wrote, Say
to Archippus, 'falce lteecl to tlze ministris, Sto. Hence we may
observe,

l. That even good ministers sometimes grow indiffer-
ent to their duty, and need a spur.

2. If private admonition does not suffice, they must be
rebuked, by the whole Church, or by some public person
in the name of the whole Church.
