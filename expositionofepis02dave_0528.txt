518 Α ΒιεςΕΒΤΑΤιοΝ οΝ THE DEATH or cunis‘r,

will, &cu Here you have the special gift of certain per-
sons known to God alone. Then in verse 7 it is shewn,
that according to the purpose of God, the same persons
always obtain that redemption which is effectually applied
through the Mediator, In whom we lzczve redemptz'on through
his blood, &a Those, therefore, who are specially given
to Christ by election, always derive saith, remissiori of
sins, sanctification, and salvation from the death of Christ,
or the beneficial application of his being given to them, at
the same time. St. Augustine understood nothing else
than eternal election by this giving. (ln Johan. tract. 107)
He says, yhe Fatlzer would not have given them to tlte Son,
unless he had elected them. And (De praedest. Sanctor. cap.
16) he demonstrates, that those who were thus given to
the Son, were also called in such a peculiar manner, that
Christ crucified should not become to them a stumbling-
block or foolishness‚ but the power and wisdom of God,
effectually to work in them faith and salvation. See the
words of the Author‚ which Ι omit for the sake of brevity.
Therefore, it must either be denied that some certain per-
sons were specially given to Christ the Mediator by God
the Father, or it must at the same time be confessed that
the Mediator had a special regard to them in his offering.
2. Secondly, the same is evinced by those passages
which teach that Christ, conscious of the will of the
Father, by his special care directs and infallibly brings to
salvation the aforesaid persons who were specially given to
him. Which would not be done beyond doubt, unless the
death of Christ, which is the meritorious cause of all-saving
grace granted to us, had been by some special design des-
tined for these personS, as saving and quickening them.
But let us observe the words of Scriptum, (John xvii. 9) I
prayfor· them, lpray 1ιοί]ον tlte world, but for them which
Thou has! given me, for· they are thirle. And ver. 12, Those
ilmt thou gaves! me I have lsept. And ver. 19, For their salies

I sanclis& myself, that they alm might be sanctfied through
the trullr. Nothing is more clear than that two things are

affirmed in these passages3 First, That not all nien pro-
miscuously, but some persons especially, were given by
