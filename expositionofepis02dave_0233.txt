EXPOSITION

OF

THE FOURTH 4ΟΗΛΡΤΕΗ.

Ι ΡΗΕΜῙΒΕ a few things concerning the argument of this ·
Chapter; afterwards Ι shall proceed direct to the explica-
tion of the context Therefore‚ after having delivered the
domestic precepts, which are acconimodated to individiials
according to the varied condition of the persons, the Apos-
tle reverts to certain general exhortations, which he pro-
pounds to all in common. To these he immediately sub-
joins an honourable mention of Tychicus and Onesimus,
by whom this Epistle was sent to the Colossians. At
length he salutes by name those of the many pious persons
who then dwelt at Rome, and commands this Epistle to be

publicly read in the Church, and so concludes it.
The principal divisions of this Chapter are three:
Exhortations,
Commendations,
Salutations.

He exhorts to three things :
Perseverance in prayer3 in verses 2, 3, 4.

Wisdom in conversation3 vers. 5.
Discretion in speech ; vers. 6.
He commends to them two eminent men,
Tychicus, vers-7, 8: Onesimus3 vers-9.
As to the rest of this Epistle, almost the whole is taken
up with salutations, and a few occasional additions.

Let us come to the context.
