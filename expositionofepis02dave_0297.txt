place, whereby he is rendered more acceptahle and com-
mendable to his Colossian brethren.

This Epaphras was the Minister of the Colossians, alid
sent at this time to the Apossse, to refer to him the state

his opinion about the controversies with which that Church
was agitated. For so the Churehes vvere accustomed to
resort to the Apostles as orae-les, even at the remotest clis-
tanne. For this purpose it is most likely Epaphras was
sent. Of the praises of Epaphras we have spoken at the
seventh verse of the first Chapter. We shall therefore now
notice those only, which are here expressly alleged by the
Apostle, in order thathe might procure for him more kind-
ness and esteem among the Colossians.
