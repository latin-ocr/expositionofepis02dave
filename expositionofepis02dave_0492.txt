is not given (Matt. xiii. ll.) No mooe can come unco me, ex-
cept it were given uoto him of my Fotlzer (John vi. 65.) By
grace are ‘st’ saved, through faz'lh ; oud thal not of yornselves:
it is the gift of God (Ephes. ii. 8.) All men have not saith
(2 Thess. iii. 2.) So likewise as to repentance, regenera-
tion‚ sanctification, all which are given to some because
the special mercy of God procures them, but are denied to
others, because the same mercy does not unfold its riches
to them. Turn thou vs unco thee, Ο Lorrl, aud wc shall be
turned (Lament. v. 21.) He halh merces on whom he will, ond
whom he will he hardeneth (Rom. ix. 18.) Wln'clz were horn,
not of blood, nor of the will of theflesh, nor os the will of

gives or denies to men those means, by which union with
Christ and salvation are immediately connected, according

have stoutly defended against the Pelagians. Ambrose, on
Luke vii. 9, says, Gocl calls whom he thinks fit, ond mulces

We know that grace is not given to all men, nor according to
the merits of their will lo whom it is given. In the same
Epistle he teaches further, That those to whom this grace is
not given, deffersor the most part by no merit, no willfrom
olhers‚ hut are iu α similar case with those to whom it is given.
As in natural birth the formation by Divine power precedes
all will of man to be born; so in spiritual birth, in which
we begin to put off the old man, no mon con hace α good
will of his own moti0n; as Fulgentius observes (lib. de
Incaru. δι Grat. cap. 19,) and again, (cap. 21) If God by
his grace should not give co man, mon could never be willing to
believe in God, because grace does not find this will, bnt pro-
duces it in man. It is clear, therefore, that God does not
give those internal means promiscuously to all men, by
which they may apply to themselves the death of Christ.
Nor can our opponents here pretend, that this Divine
giving and not giving of saith derives its origin, from the
