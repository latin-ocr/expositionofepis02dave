himself and by himself3 a property which God hath re-
served sor himself alone.

Now in the last place it may be inquired, whether all
anger is evil and unlawful, since the Apostle advises us to
lay aside anger without any distinction. lt is clear, that
anger is not an affection evil in itself3 both because God,
who cannot he the author of evil, hath implanted in the
human mind the faculty of anger3 as especially because
we read that Christ was moved with' anger, Mark iii. 5.
Hence Basil calls anger, the very strength of the soal,- Da-
mascenus, the gaardsman qf the judgmcnt. Because Eli
had not this anger, he stirred up against himself the Di·-
vine vengeanoe, as says Gregory, Moral 5, cap. 30. Hence
the Apostle enjoins, Be ‘ise (mgr-y and sin not. That is to
say, Be ye angry where there is a fault with which ye
ought to be angry3 otherwise, as Ambrose rightly says, z‘t
is not α virtue, but mali-mess and remissness.

But that we may distinguish the natural and lawful af·
fection from the inordinate and unlawful einotion of the
same, we say that that anger is good which arises from a
good motive, namely, from the love of God, οι· of our
neighbour3 and which tends to a good end, as the glory
of God, and the correction of our neighbour; which pro-
ceeds according to a prescribed mle, awaiting or following
for instance the determination of reason. Hither pertains
that saying of Augustine, in De civit. Dei, lib. 9. cap. 5,
Under our discipline ic is not so mach inquired whether a pious
mind may be angry, as whercjbre he is cmgry .· Jbr· ηο one qs
sound reflection would reprehend the being angry with. α sinner
rlzat lte may be corrected. And Bernard, Epist. 69, says,
Not to be angry witlz what one ouglzt to be augry, is to be un-
willing to amend a sin: to be more angry than one ought to be,
is to add sin to sin. Lastly, Basil in his Hoinily De Ira,
would have anger to be a brz'dled horse, wlzz'clz obeys reason
as a curb. Such anger is not condemned.

On the other hand, it is clear that that anger is evil
which arises from a bad beginning, or which tends to a
bad end, or is exercised in an improper manner. If it
should arise from a love of praise, or hatred of one’s
