inscrutable abyss of Divine predestination, and not to the
differences of human wills or actions, as the Pelagians and
Semipelagians did. See also cap. ll, where 116 refers it to
the will of God, and secret predestination‚ that God does
not grant assistance to some. Piosper plainly asseits that
the means of saving grace, or the call to grace, are denied
to some, (Resp. 4 ad Cap. Gall.) where he does not repel
this obJection as false, Thac all men are not called to grace,
but acknowledges that this may be truly said of all those,
to wlzom lze hatlt not made known tlte mystery of tlze crass (ff
Christ, and tlze redemption of leis blood. And (Sentent. 4) as
afore-mentioned, We cannot say tltat there is a callos grace
where there are as yet no sacraments of the Clzmclz. In which
passage is to be observed, that he opposes those who de-
fend the opinion of grace procured for and offered to all ’
for Christ's sake, and who imagine, I know not what call-
ing and sufficiency of grace, in the niidst of the darkness
ofD Paganism. W hat Prosper has spoken of little children,
we may say of adults, (Resp. ad obj. 4) Let them be proved
to be called. 111 any way, to whom the planter could not preaclz,
nor the waterer assist. Fulgentius, (lib. l, de verit. Praedest.)
Το men who are capable ‘ff reason, Gocl either granis or denies
means suitable to salvation, slzewing leis justice towards some,
his mercy to others. His meaning is, That God sends or
does not send preachers of the Gospel, according to his
good pleasure3 he sends when he is willing to shew his
niercy3 he does not send when he chooses to manifest his
justice. Ι add also from Fulgentius, that the common
guilt which all men have contracted in Adam, suffices to
justify the denial of the grace of the Gospel to any man.
His words are, Mis grace of God by ulzich ae are saved es
not givenfor ants preceding good desem not yet zs it deniedsot·
any preceding evil desen. 1'02 the first man transmitted tlte
deser-ts of llis sin to all lzis posterity. &a From which it ap-
pears, that according to the opinion of Fulgentius, origi.-
nal 3111 13 a sufficientlyjust cause why the grace of Christ
should be denied to any man. Which Aquinas himself
acknowledges‚ (2ss 2²⁶³· qu. 2²²· art. 5⁰· resp. ad lm.) where
116 says, tlze help Of.» orme is mercg‘fully given to some, to others
