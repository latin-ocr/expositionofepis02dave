and of Christ in offering himself, was limited to the elect
alone, as far as the passion of Christ is joined with the
infallible effect of salvation as to individuals.

TEsr.¹ 3. Aquinas also observes (Quaest. disp. de grat.
Christi. art. 7, resp. ad 4,) lee merit qs Christ as to its 3²{f'
ficz'ency equally regards all men, but not as to z'ts efficacy ;
which arises partly from free-will, partly¹ from the electiore (ff
God, through which tlte effect of the merits (ff Christ is merci-
fully conferred upon some, but is by his just judgment witk-
drawn from others. What Aquinas says, that it arises
partly from free-will, that the merits of Christ as to their
efficacy do not equally regard all men, is to be understood
with respect to those who are lost, who, of their own free-
will turn themselves away from the fountain of salvation: Ι
11111 what he says, that this inequality arises partly from
the election of God, is to be understood with respect to
those who are saved, who, because God, according to the
good pleasure of his election, has special compassion on
them, receive from the fountain of salvation whatever is
necessary to effect their salvation. That this was the sen-
timent of Aquinas appears from his answer 10 1116 last ar-
gument, where 116 sayS, Tlmt this is emfferred j'reely upon
men by God, that they obtain the efficacy os tlze merit qf
Christ. If the effect of the merits of Christ is mereifully
conferred on some certain persons by the electior] of God,
and is at the same time denied to others, who can doubt
that Christ, being most conscious of the election of God
and of his calling, offered himself and his merits specially
for these persons, and to the price of his death, which was
most sufficient in itself, added moreover the most effectual
and special intention of his will, in order to effect 1116 sal-
vation of these elect persons? To this those words refer
(John x. 15,) Ι lay down 7719* lffesor tlze sheep, namely, with
some special intention of effectually redeeming and deli-
vering them, and leading them to life eternal3 as may be
collected from the whole discourse of our Saviour at that
time.
