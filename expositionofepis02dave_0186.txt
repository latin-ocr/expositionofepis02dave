176 ΑΝ ΕΧΡοειτιοΝ or ετ. PAUL’s C‘hap. iii.

is the duty of pious children, first to go to their parents,
to enquire both whether they may, and whether they wish
to do without their help and assistance: If, therefore, they
ought not to do this without the advice of their parentS‚
much less so against their will.

4. We have the authority of the Council of Gemgra,
cap. 16. toni. 1, Whatever children separate from their pa-
rents under pretence qs Divine vvorslzip, neither pay them due
rever-enee, let them be anathema. Bellarmin endeavours to
restrict it to those alone who forsake parents that are
needy, and betake themselves against their consent into
monasteries. But this answer is of no weight, For first,
the words of the Council are general3 Whoever separate
from their parents, without the gloss of Bellarmin, placed in
extreme want. Secondly, it is not the part of a modest
child, when he hears his parent saying that he cannot do
without his assistance, and remonstrating against his pro-
posal to enter a monastery, yet to decide in opposition to
it. Lastly, it is harsh to restrict the obedience of children
to the extreme poverty only of their parents.

5. Basil in Quaest‚ largely explained, quaest. 15, plainly
assertS, that children are not to be received into moteasleries
unless they shall be offered by their parents. Bellarmin
answers, that is to be understood of children under age
alone3 thatis, males before their fourteenth year, and fe-
males before their welfeh, are not to be received without
the consent of their parents; but after this age they may
enter although the parents should be unwilling. But Ba-
sil does not distribute children in that place, into adults
and those under age3 but into ἐρημα γονέων, και ὑπὸ γονεῖς
ὂντα, those who are destitute of parents, and those whose pa-
rents areyet living, and have the care of their children. He
denies that the latter are to be received without the consent
of their parents,

Now let >“us proceed to solve the arguments of Bellar-
min. He opposes it by passages of Scripture, testimonies
of the Fathers, and of Councils, and by moral reasons.

l. He brings that passage of Scripture out of Gen.
