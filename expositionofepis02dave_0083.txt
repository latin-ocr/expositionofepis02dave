Ver-8· EPISTLE TO THE COLOSSIANS. 73

3. The opinion of good men, together with the testi-
mony of the conscience, is sufficient for picus persons in
this evil world, against the lip of those speaking lies; for
as the Poet wisely sang,

Fa'lse praise can charm, unreal shame control
leom, but ιι vicious ον α sz'clcly soul?
Hor. Epist. lib. 1. Ep. 16.

4. Let not the godly ever be provoked by the example
of evil speakers to speak evil again3 but let them say with
the Apostle‚ Bez'ng reviled we bless .· being persecuted we suf-

1. Because it makes that which is most precious and
peculiar to man, namely his faculty of speech, foul and
ridiculous3 a gift ‘not granted usfor &Aspar-pose, as it is well
observed in VirgiL AEn. 4. 647. For obscene and scurri-
