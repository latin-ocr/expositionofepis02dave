in Collat. 17. cap. 17, is therefore to be disregarded‚ that

of the more formidable and dangerous diseases, particularly madness.

† Cassian, to whom these two sentiments are attributed, was a Monk of
the fifth Century, a native of Scythia, but educated in the llIonastery of
Bethlehem3 who afterwards wandered through Egypt and Thebais with
another lWonk of the name of Germanus, for the sake of conferring with
meu of similar inclinations. He was at length ordained by Chrysostoni,
and settled at. Marseilles, where he founded two M onasteries, one for nien
and another for virgins. He composed a code of lnstructions for Monks‚
with the pieces above-mentioned, entitled ‘⁶ Collatioues‚” or the subject of
his conferences with others on the principles of Monachism, principally de-
rived from the discipline and manners which prevailed among the §yrian
and Egyptian Monks. He engaged in the controversy against Nestorius
respecting the union of the two natures in Christ. The conclusion of his
appeal to Nestorius as given by Du Pin, is remarkable. He says, advert-
ing to the orthodox faith respecting the Person of Christ, “ 'Tis the saith
“ of this Creed which hath given you admittance to Baptism3 'tis by that
“ that you have been regenerated; 'tis by this faith that you have received
‘⁶ the Eucharist and the Lord's Supper. Lastly‚ Ι speak it with a sorrow,
“ ’Tis that which hath raised you to the holy Ministry, to be a Deacon and
“ Priest, and made you capable of the Episcopal Dignity. What have
“ you done Ρ Into what a sad condition have you cast yourself? By los-
“ ing the saith of the Creed you have lost all; the Sacraments of your
“ Priesthood and Episcopacy are grounded upon the truth of the Creed.
“ One of these two things you must do; either you must confess, 'l'hat
‘⁶ he is God that is born of a Virgin, and so detest your error3 or, if you
“ will not make such aConfession, you must renounce your Priesthood;
“ there is no middle way. If you have been orthodox‚ you are now an
“ apostate3 and if you are at present orthodox, how can you be a Deacon,
“ Priest, or Bishop ? thy were you so long in an error? thy did you
‘⁶ stay so long without contradicting others ?'' Thus we see how a denial
of the supreme Divinity of the Lord that bought us was regarded in those
days. On the doctrine of grace, however, and the strength of Free-will,
as developed in his Collationes‚ Prosper considered Cassian himself greatly
in error, and opposed his sentiments. It would seem, indeed, as Mosheim
intimates, that in this respect he was a Semi-pelagian. His sentiments
cited by our Expositor‚ would, moreover, certainly lead to such doctrines
as have since been the disgrace of his Church, the occasion of many evils,
and a hindrance to Religion in the world ; and when we find them applaud-
