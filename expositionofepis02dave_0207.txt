Ver. 22. EPISTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 197

but notwithstanding, the Apostle gives a contrary precept3
in which every word hath its weight to demonstrate the
equity and even the necessity of the precept.

Servants. He addresses Christians, and yet he still calls
them servants; Δουλοι.] This word does not denote such
domestics as we now employ3 who are in reality free and
free-born, although they serve others for hire: but it de-
notes such as the ancients used3 who were either taken in
war or bought, and on that account were wholly in the
power of their masters.

Concerning the foundation of this servitude, whether it
bejust or violent, Ι shall not contend: yet it appears to
have been allowed and established by the law of Nations.
Hence Aristotle asserts, Polit. i. 3, that servants of this
kind were nothing else than ὄργανα ἔμψυχα, certain animated
instruments of their masters. And even among the sacred
writers these servants are reckoned among the goods and
possessions of their masters, Job. i. 33 and the servant is
called in Exod. xxi. 21, the money of his master. The
Apostle therefore shews by this very name, that they were
bound to obedience : and on that. account he adds his com·
mand,

Servants‚ obey in all things] This precept was proposed
in these same words to children, vers. 20, and, as it was
then said, involved two things; humility in receiving the
commands of another, and alacrity in executing the same:
for these two are intimated under this one word ὑπακουειν.
But what he adds, iu all tlzz'ngS, that is to be restricted to
things lawful and honest, and those which regard the duty
of servants: for if a master shall order his servant to do
any thing which is either contrary to piety or foreign from
the duty of a servant, he is, not bound to obey3 because
his master ought not to command such things. Rightly,
therefore, has Jerome put in this exception, IN ALL TfflNGs;
vamely, says he, in wlzich alze lord {gf tlze fleslz does not com-
mand contrary to the Lord qf tlze spirit. Therefore, the
Apostle does not include impious and unlawful obedience,
when he enjoins them to obey in all things, but he forbids
