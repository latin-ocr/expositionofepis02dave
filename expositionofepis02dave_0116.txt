and lchnlness: since, as Augustine observes, there are many
who would more readesy give all they have to seed {he poor,
llum become beggars themselves ὑφῆψε God. Indeed it often
happens, that works of charity and mercy give occasion
for pomp and pride. In whatever condition we are, them
we have need to put on lunnz'lz'ty: In prosperity (that is,
when we abound in temporal or spiritual riches), lest we
become insolent towards God, as in the, case of Uzziah, 2
Chron. xxvi. 16, and of the Israelites, Hosea xiii. 63 lest
we despise and oppress our neighbour as did Haman‚ in
Esther iij.6; or the pharisee, in Luke xviii. ll. For, as

3. If we observe how God is affected towards the hum—

lxvi. ‘23 and beyond all others he adorns and enriches therh
more and more with his gifts, Matt. >ti-253 Psal. xviii. 273
Luke i. 52, 53. Parisiensis not unaptly calls the human
heart α spiritual vacuum. And as nature does not suffer a
corporeal vacuum, but rather impels some bodies into
places not suited to their nature ς so the grace of God does
not allow of a spiritual vacuum in the heart of the hum-
ble, but sends streams of heavenly blessings to fill it.
