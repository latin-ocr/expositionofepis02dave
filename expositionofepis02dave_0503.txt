of the same light, or does not do what he can of himself,
does not obtain it; he who thus becomes a partaker of
grace, has just ground of glorying in himself, because, by
his own free-will, he made himself to differ from another,
from whom he was not made to differ by any special gift of
Divine mercy.

ARGUMENT 6. If, the death of Christ being supposed,
according to the decree of God, the gift or denial of grace
to individuals proceeds not from the absolute freedom of
God, but from the difference of human wills and actions,
then it is easy for any one to give an account why the
Gospel was denied to one nation, why it was granted to
another, and why saith, and quickening and regenerating
grace is given to some individuals and not to others. For
on the part of those that have it, it is answered, That the ’
light of the Gospel was given to them, because they made
a good or not a bad use of the light of nature. On the
part of those that have it not, it is answered, that they re-
main destitute of the light of the Gospel, because they
have not made a good use of the light of nature. And so
among Christians, if it should be inquired‚ why one man
has faith and regenerating grace, and another has it not?
on the part of those who have it, it is answered, Because
they were willing to believe, and were unwilling to put
any obstacle in the way3 and on the part of those who
have it not, Because they would not believe, and would
not remove the obstacle to grace. At the same time, there
is not one word about the special call, according to his
own purpose, wherewith God powerfully inclines the hearts
of those to believe whom specially he is willing to pity.
Ι now add, that it is the Pelagians who give so obvious a
reason why grace is obtained or not on the part of men,
and that it is condemned by all the orthodox3 who always
limit the gift or denial of efficacious grace to the secret
purpose of the good pleasure of God3 nor do they think
that, the death of Christ being admitted, God is so bound
to administer his own grace promiscuously, that to have it
or not to have it, depends on the difference of human wills.
