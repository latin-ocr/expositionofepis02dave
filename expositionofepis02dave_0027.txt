Ver· 3. EPISTLE To THE coLosslANS. 17

length completed. It was not badly said by Parisiensis,
De legib. cap. 28, All sin is reclconed to be dead that hatlz not
extingaislzed the life (ff ἕνεκα wherefore ic is accountecl dead,
since it is not permitted to ναῖε. Ι1; would be easy to confirm
this by many testimonies of the Scriptures. For they
every where teach, that those who are born again in bap-
tism not only die to sin sacramentally, but also receive the
Spirit of Christ, by whose virtue and efficacy the lusts of
the flesh are really mortified in them. Rom. vi. 6, We know
that our old man is crucffied with Christ, that tlze body qf sin
might be destroyed. They moreover teach, that we stipulated
with God, to the perpetual study of mortification and a
godly life: Thus speaks Peter, Epis. i. cap. iii. 21, where
he calls baptism tlze answer cf α good conscience towards God.
We now understand what the Apostle meant with himself,
when he says that the Colossians are dead; and in what
sense Christians are said to be dead to sin by their baptism.-

Now it remains that we examine, in the second place,
the reason of this consequence, Ye ought not to sede, or set
your qffectz’ons on earthly things, because με are dead: Which
is most forcible on many accounts.

First, it prevails from the removal ofthe cause to the remo-
val of the effect. For the effects of the dominion of sin are
to savour and to seelc earthly things .· but in those who are (lead
to sin, sin has lost this lordly power: it cannot, therefore,
compel them to unlawful lusts. The Apostle affirms this in
express words, Rom. vi. 7, He wlzo z's dead isfreefiom sin .-
and ver. 14, Sin shall not have domim‘on over you. This may
be illustrated from the similitude of a tyrant who formerly
flourished and domineered, but was afterward wounded,
subdued, and cast into prison. For as he, whilst protect—
ed by his guards, held the citadel, ruled the miserable ci-
tizens, and compelled them t'o obey his commands3 but
after he had been stripped of his defencc, forced from his
citadel, overcome, and bound, was derided and despised by
all, neither had any one who regarded his directions: so
sin, whilst it lives in the unregenerate man, urges and im-
pels him to all wickedness3 but after its dominion is bro-
ken, it can do nothing· except to those who voluntarily give
up themselves to it again.
