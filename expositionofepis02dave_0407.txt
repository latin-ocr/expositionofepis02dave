less to themselves by their own unbelief3 but they do not
cause such an ordination to be made void, or thatit should
not be acknowledged to have been established by the
death of Christ to these unbelievers. For if we admit
this, any unbeliever may pretend, Althongh I should believe
the Gospel, I should not be delivered from my sins by the
death of Christ, because the death of Christ had no ordination
according to which Icould be a partalcer of it. Which, on
the other hand. is opposed by the words of Christ himself,
John iii. 17, 18, Gocl sent not his Son into the world to con·

REPLY 16. We deny that there is any thing absurd in
the aforesaid sentiment, which we have demonstrated to
be true, and agreeable to Divine wisdom. But that which
is objected, As to all sor whom Christ died, in the death of
Christ himseff is included also the infallible application of his
death, that does not seem to us to be conceded. For the
oblati0n of Christ considered merely in itself, altogether
obtains from God, that every individual who is willing· to
