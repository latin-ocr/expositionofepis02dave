64 AN EXPOSlTION or ετ. PAUL’S Clzap. iii.

uo avail, in order to shew that human salvation entirely
depends on the spirit of Christ mortifying and quickening
us3 and that therefore we must aim at mortification before
all other things.

As to what pertains to this eighth verse now under con-
sideration, in it he effects two things. 1. After his dissua-
sion from carnal vices which render men infamous among
all the sober and prudent, he dissuades also from all spiri-
tual ones, which are deemed lighter faults, which are not
accounted as vices among the generality. 2. He enumer-
ates some expressly, that from these it may be understood
that others of the same kind are to be condemned and
abandoned.

l. But now με also put off all these] In this general
persuasion we must first observe the circumstance of time
denoted by the particle now. As if he had said, Ye were
overwhelmed with spiritual vices as long as sin lived in

the name (ff Clu-istium .· but let us believe tlzat this is tlze very
reason we shall bejudgecl, is we falsely claim to ourselves a
name which dotlz not belong to us. Cyprian also says, We
are Philosophers not in word, but in deecl ; neither do we talk
great tlzz'ngs but we live them. Now, therefore, we espe-
cially must lay aside those vices, because we are Christians
born again. ¹

2. Secondly, We should well weigh that act to which
the Colossians are exhorted by the word 02710'920323 which
may be explained either to put qffi as men put off their old
and dirty clothes, οι· to lay aside, from the sight, from the
affections, and from all the senses‚ as the corpses of the
