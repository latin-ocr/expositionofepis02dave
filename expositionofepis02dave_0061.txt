methods3 for the necessity of life3 for discharging the
duties of benevolence; for enjoyment, or making them the
end. This last is that vice of πλεονεξιοις, to be avoided and
mortified.

2. It may be enquired, Why he annexes covetousness to
these carnal vices; for it seems rather to be reckoned
among those that are spiritual. But the Apostle wisely
inserts covetousness among them3 and that on these ac-
counts:

1. Because it is of a middle kind, between carnal and
spiritual sins. Those vices are properly designated carnal,
which have a sensible delight in a sensible object3 as we
see in the sins of gluttony and luxury : Those are as pro-
perly designated spiritual, which seek spiritual delight

amid spiritual objects; as pride about perso'nal excel· -

lence. Now covetousness occupies a middle place: it is
carnal in respect of the object, because it seeks delight in
external and corporeal things3 it is spiritual in respect of
the delight itself3 because a covetous man hath delight
only in this, that he possesses riches.

2. Because it affords incentives, causes, and occasions
to both, namely, to carnal and spiritual vices. Hence
spring the greatest incentives and excitements to luxury,
to pride, to anger, and envy. Take away covetousncss,
and you will eradicate the greatest part of vices; for z't is
tlze root of all evil, 1 Tim. vi. 10.

3. Now, in the last place, we must see in what way it is
called idolatry. Let Aquinas answer, Not in lcz‘ud3 because
a covetous man does not intend in regard to his money to ac-
count z't as a Gocl; but in similitude; because lle pays to it su-
preme obedience. So Ales3 A σπείους man is called an ido-
later, because as an idolater behaves to an idol, so in α similar
mamzer does a covetous man tostis money. Chrysostom, in
Hom. 65, in xi. Joan, expatiates thus on this comparison,
As an idolater looks to, and regards with veneration, lzis idol .·
so α covetous man the riches he has heaped toget-lzer .· ηον dares
to touch them. As the one heaps together hes idols z'n a certain
corner, and shuts them up in closets and witla holts,· so tlte

other does to leis money. In short, the former ‘tcorslcips the
