that after the fourteenth year children may enter upon a
monastic life against the will of their parents, but after the
tenth year it shall be lawful for them to do it. Bellarmin
saw that this was contrary to his argument, and did not
square with his distinction eoncerning children under age
and adults; therefore, in conformity with his own Jesuiti-
cal integrity, 118 adds four to the number.

³⁸ This was an important Council, numerously amended, and remarkable
for the character of some of its Constitutions. It was held in the year 805,
under King Arnoldus, at his palace called Tribur‚ situated near Mentz.
The Archbishops of Mentz, Cologne, and Treves attended it, with nine-
teen German Bishops. It passed 58 Canons, several of which were confir-
matory of many of those novelties and superstitious with which the Church
now began to abound, and with which it was 3111101811, and brought into a state
of bondage issuing in the subsequent dark age. The Canon referred to
above is thus stated by Du Pin ι “ Τ118 four and twentieth imports, that a
Maid, who had taken the Veil by her own desire, and without any con·
straint, before she is 12 years old, is obliged to retain her virginity, if she
hath worn that habit for a year and a day, and nobody may take her out of
the Monastery.'’

The Doctors and Fathers of the Church of Rome are in the present day
vehemently incensing the popular clamour against 'l'ithes. The l3th and
14111 03110118 of this Council had respect to them, as existing and claimed by
her in those days. After the 13th had laid down the division, and appro-
priation ς 1118 14111 goes on “ 10 preserve the Tithes to the ancient Churches,
and annexes the Tithes of new broken-up lands to them; but if new houses
be built four miles from other cliui-ebes, in a wood, or other place, and a
Church be built there by the consent of the Bishop, they may put in a
Priest and give him the newTithes.” Thus was established, in this part ofthe
Church‚ that system which the church of Rome had been labouring, for three
preceding centuries, to establish throughout her growing empire. And wefur-
ther 888, from the decrees of this Council, how far Papal Supremacy had begun
to extend its grasp. The thirtieth Canon appoints, ⁶⁸ that in memory ofSt.
Peter, the Holy Roman and Apostolic See ought to be honoured, it beingjust‚
that that Chureh‚ which is the Mother of the priestly dignity‚ should be the
Mistress of Ecclesiastical order, so that ’tis fit, that men bear and endure the
yoke she lays upon them, although it be almost insupportablel! Neverthe-
less ’tis ordered, that if any Priest or Deacon be accused of carrying forged
Letters from the Pope to stir up any troubles, or lay any snares for the mi-
nisters of the Church‚ the Bishop may with due respect to the Pope, stop
his proceedings7 till he hath written to the Holy See.'’
