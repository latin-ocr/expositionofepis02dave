him.- and lib. ad Constant. he advises, not to overstep the
immutable constitution of the Apostolic fuich, lest our saith
should change wilh time, and not continue that <ff the un-
changeable Gospel. And Athanasius, De consiliis3 Ifyou
are disciples of the Gospel, walle in the Scriptures: ifyou
wish to invent any thing different to the Seriphum, why do
you enter the lists with us, who cannot endure to hear what is
not in them? Tertullian, De anima, cap. l, says 3 Who
shall reveal what God harh concealed ? It is better to be igno-
rant with God on our side because he has not revealed, than to
flatter ourselves with the false knowledge which the presump-
tion ofman impares. Jerome, in Titus i. observes3 Wz‘tlz-
out the authority of the Scrz'ptures prating is not to be credited,
Augustine frequently teaches, that no one is to be bound to
believe human authority without the foundations os Scripture ,··
as in Epist. 19 to Jerome, and Epist. 48 to Vincent Do·
natist. These things may suffice to open the perfidy of
the Papists.

It also concerns this fidelsty, not to withhold from the
people any part of the doctrine of salvation. For God
gives this in command to all his ministers3 Ye shall not add
unto the word which I command you, neither shall ue climinish
from it, Deut. iv. 2. If any man shall take away from the
words Qf the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his
part out (ff the book of lffes Rev. xxii. 19. And Paul on
this account, when he endeavours to shew how faithfully
he had conducted himself in the ministry, says, Iam pure
from the blood (ff all men, because he had withheld nothing
from them, but had declarecl the whole counsel of God, Acts
xx, 26, 27. Here, therefore, the Papists greatly sin, who
plead often for the worship of images, the sale of indul-
gences, and the observance of their traditions3 but con-
cerningjustification by saith in the blood of Christ, and
other fundamental doctrines of the GospeL they are more
dumb among the people than fish. Those also among our-
selves sin, who do not endeavour to imbue their people
with a knowledge of all those things (at least summarily)
which are necessary to be believed or done for the attain-
ment of salvation.
