378 Α DISSERTATION ΟΝ THE DEATH OF CHRIST-

reason thus, and at the same time retain the distinction of
the Schoolmen. that Christ diedfor all ‘men sufficiently, for
tlze elect effectually. Therefore, that Christ died for all men
sufficiently, they understand thus: The death of Christ is
sufficient to redeem all men, but he would not die for all:
The death of Christ is in itself, and in its intrinsic value,
a sufficient ransom for all, but it was not paid for all.
But it never occurred to the Schoolmen to defend this suf-
ficiency only, and to deny absolutely that Christ died for
all. Nor can it easily be explained how, without evident
contradiction, it can be affirmed, that Christ died or was
offered up sufficiently for all, and at the same time be al-
together denied that he was unwilling to die or be offered
up for many. As to those, therefore, who admit such an
oblation and sufficiency in the death of Christ as is merely
hypothetical, if it is referred to all, I answer, That a me-
dium can and ought to be assigned between that mere suf-
ficiency of price and its real application. For the or-
dination of God manifested in the Gospel, according to
which this death of Christ is proposed to be received by
every one that repents and believes, proves that this suffi-
ciency and actual application is appointed as a kind of me-
dium. For in this ordination of God, according to which
the death of Christ is appointed and proposed as a cause of
salvation to every living person, applicable by saith, there
is contained less than in the real application, but there is
contained something more than in the mere and bare suf-
ficiency of the thing considered in itself, this conditional
ordination being excluded, which regards every partaker
of human nature. This, therefore, is that very medium
which the adversaries deny can be assigned, but still urge
and enquire, what that medium is, and where it is to be
found, which goes beyond the bare sufficiency, and yet
does not attain to the real application. l answer, That
there is not any act, caused by the death of Christ, indif-
ferently regarding every individua13 but there is a title to
etei-nal life, founded on the death of Christ, indifferently
regarding every individua} under the condition of faith:
That there is not in God an obtaining of remissiori, and a
