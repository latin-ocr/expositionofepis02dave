Chap. iv. THE SECOND PROPOSlTloN s'rATssn, ἀο. 439

’ like reason we cannot pray to God that he would convert
any unbelievers to the saith, or that he would bring any
wicked men to repentance, with a full persuasion that he
can do that which we ask, because what he hath secretly
decreed concerning these things before the foundation ofthe
world is concealed from us.

Thirdly, and lastly, Because if nothing else is judged
possible to be done, except those things which God hath
decreed to be done, it would follow that the Divine power
is not infinite. That power is finite which is equalized
with finite effeets‚ and is wholly drawn out into its own
act, Since as Hales rightly observes, (Part. l. qu. 21)
Irfim'te power may be drawn out into its acl, hut not ΙΙιε
whole of z't- Therefore, God can do many things which
he will not, as for instance, he can give saith to justify,‘
and save any individual person whatever. Yea‚ he can will
many things which he does not will 3 and yet leis will cannot
in any way be either new or mutable. But although lze could
wz‘sl what ke never lzath wiHed, *yet he cannot will unwillingly,
or with a new will, bnt only witlz αη. eternal will. For lze can
will what he could leave wz'lled from eternity. For lze has the
power of willing, both now and from eternity, that which ne-
vertlzeless lte neither does now will, nor ΙιαίΙι willed from eter-
πέζῃ. Thus Lombard hath rightly remarked (Lib. l, Dist.
43. Litera E.)

W'e have thought that these things should be discussed
rather at length, that it may more plainly appear that the
death of Christ is applicable to any man living, because
the condition of faith and repentance is possible to any
living person, the secret decree of predestination or pre-
terition in no wise hindering or confining this power either
on the part of God, or on the part of men. They act,
therefore, with little ‘consideration who endeavour, by the
decrees of secret election and preterition, to overthrow the
universality of the death of Christ, which pertains to any
persons whatsoever according to the tenor of the evange·
lical covenant. Thus much we have said respecting our
second proposition. Let us proceed to the third.
