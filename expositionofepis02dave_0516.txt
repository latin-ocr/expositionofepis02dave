but he leaves them unconverted, if they do resist it. Thus
the Rernonstrants speak, (Acta Synod. p. 21, Explic. 3, δι 4
art.) Is the reason be inquired why oue is conver-ted and not
another, it is answeoed, One is contet-ced because God conver-ts
him, since he does not oppose new coutumacy ; the other is not
converted, because he opposes a new contumacy. In which they
state the reason of the gift and denial of Divine and sav-
ing grace to arise from the different acts of the human

will, but a deep silence is always obser-ved by them on the

subject of God removing, of his special mercy, the stony
and rebellious heart, or his not removing it, according to
the liberty of his own will. Thus also Corvinus does not
ascribe it to the difference of Divine‚ but of human will,
that we have or have not that grace by which we are con-
verted and saved. (Contra Bogerman, p. 263.) It z‘s cer-

A little after, Granting att the oper-atinus which (iod makes
use of to effect conver-sion in us, still conversion remaz'ns so

opinion.

But very different is that of the holy and orthodox

willing or unwilling to take away the innate hardness of
the human heart. Let us produce Augustine in the 'first
place, who, always admitting the accomplishment of the
work of human redemption on the cross, contends that
some have grace because God of his special mercy hath
wrought in them that they should receive it3 and that
others have it not, because God did not choose to sosten
their rebellious hardness by having compassion upon
them. What he has stated is very plain, (Retract. lib. l,
cap. 10) What I have said, that all men are ableto turn them-
selves tofzel il the commands of God, if they are wz'lling, let
not the Pelagians thz'nlc that is spoken according to their
opinion. For it is altogether true that all men can do this ff
