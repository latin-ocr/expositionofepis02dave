410 Α DlSSERTATmN oN THE DEATH or ennisr.

On the incarnation of the Word. I will mention one or two
passages 3 Clu-ist tlze Son ofGod, having assumed a body like to
curs, because we were all exposed to death, gave leimseff up to
deathfor us allas a sacrifice to his Fatlzer· (p. 42.) Again,
(p. 48) A fter he lzad given prooss of his Divinicy, z't now re-
mained tlzat lze should offer up α sacrfficefor all, delivering the
temple of lzz's hodes to death for all, tlzat lze might set all free
from original sin, δίε. Observe, that the mark of univer-
sality is united, not 'with the intrinsic sufficiency of the
thing offered, but with the intention and act of offering,
which referred to all men. Thus Augustino (vol. 9. p.
467. Tract. 92 on John), 'I'lze blood <ff Christ was shed for
the remissiore of all sins in suclc α manner, that it can blot out
tlze site z'tseffjb7·10hick ic ἰυαε slzed. He does not say, that
there was a sufficient intrinsical value in the blood which
was shed to expiate the sins of all mankind, which is al-
lowed by all who know how to value aright the blood of
God, but he urges the manner and act of offering, and in
that respect points out its universality. Thus it ‘eoas shed
for the remissiore of als sius. It is one thing to say that the
blood of Christ has of itself and in itself a sufficient va·
lue to blot out the sins of all men, and another to affirm
that it was actually shed sor the remission of all sins, as
Augustine says. But why do I mention the holy Fathers?
The sacred Scriptures speak of the death of Christ so as
to refer its universal efficacy not to the mere dignity of the

Alexander, the Bishop whom he succeeded in the dignity A.D. 326. He
acquired the surname of Great on account of his zeal for the orthodox faith,
in opposition to all heresies, especially the Arians, from whom he suffered
the bitterest persecutione during the whole course of his episcopacy of 46
years. His works, which are numerous, contain a defence of the Holy
Trinity, :and of the Incarnation 3 of au which the best Edition is that of the
Benedictines, 3 Vols. folio, Paris, 1693. The Creed which goes by his
name, though supposed not to have proceeded immediately from his pen,
contains the best illus-tration of his sentiments. Before it is hastily rejected
hy any one, it would be well to peruse with attention the remarks upon it
in Shepherd's valuable πνοῆς-(4 Critical and Praetical Elucidation of the
Morning and Evening Prayer of the Church of England.” It may be re.
marked of modern sources of information, that Gorton’s Biographical Dic.
tionary has an extended Life of Athanasius, well drawn up, and Clarke’s
0‘ Succession of Sacred Literature'* contains a good account of his works.
