fwely through. lzz's mercy, wlzo bath said, I wiLL HAVE
MERcv on WHoM I WlLL HAVE Mssncv. For that grace
should be given or not given, according to the use made
of natural endowments, as it may be rightly or not, or (as
others say) according as a man does or does not what he
can, is the same with the Fathers, as to be given- of merit,
and denied of demerit. Further, neither will the decree of
the African fathers in their Synodical epistle* stand good.
Grace itself is in 110 way aclmowledged, unless z't be given, and
as long as z't is not in man, so long he necessarily opposes it in

granted, according to his common mode of acting‚ God
gives grace to all, if they make a right use of their natural
endowmentS, and does not give it, if they do not make a

This accusation was preferred to a synod of fourteen Bishops‚ held at Dios-
poliS‚ antiently called Lydda, a city of Palestine. Eulogius of Caesaria
was President, and John of Jerusalem held the second place. Pelagius ap-
peared and disowned the errors attributed to him. Augustine has recorded
the acts of this Council in the Book of Pelagius's acts, and has also given
an abridgment of them in his 106th Letter.--Vide Du Pz'n and Milner.
