420 A DlSSERTATION ON THE DEATH or cuaisr.

condition of faith, unless it appeared to them beyond a
doubt, that this conditional covenant was made and es-
tablished for all by the will of God. But the Apostles did
this, and we do it3 therefore we acknowledge that this co-
venant was established with each and every man, that is,
with the whole human race. But perhaps some one may
say, Although this covenant, confirmed by the blood of
Christ, should not pertain to all men promiscuously, but
only to the elect, yet remission of sinâ€˜s and salvation may
be proposed and offered to all, under the hypothesis of
saith, because it is certain that the elect alone will perse-
veringly believe3 and therefore none of the non-elect can
ever cause this covenant, which is conditional on the part
of God, to be false or violated as to himself. But this
answer is of no avail. For the truth of every conditional
proposition is to be considered, before the condition is
allowed3 therefore, although the condition should never
be acted upon, still the truth of the conditional proposi-
tion, when rightly made, ought to appear. Therefore, this
conditional proposition or promise, [filma skalt believe,
thy sins shall beforgiven thee, is false as to Cain and Judas,
unless a true foundation of the connexion should be
granted, in case it should happen that they believed.
Nor does it at all relate to the truth of the conditional
proposition whether they should believe or not, since in
such a proposition, the reason of the connexion is regard-
ed, not the truth or falsity of the separate parts. [fPeter
should cle-ny Christ, he shall obtain eternal life, is a false pro-
position, on account of the weakness of the connexion,
and yet each part separately was true. If Peter should not
believe, he will not obtain elermtl lg'fe, is a true proposition,
and yet each part taken separately was false. For Peter
both believed and obtained eternal life. For a like reason,
therefore, this conditional declaration [f thou skalt believe,
thou skalt obtain remissiore (ff sins and eternal lffe, would be
false as to a non-elect person, although it should be pre-
supposed that he would never believe, if the antecedent
reason and cause of connexion were wanting: but it is
wanting, unless a conditional covenant confirmed with all
