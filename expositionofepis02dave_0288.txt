278 AN EXPOSlTloN or- s'r. PAUL’S Claeap. iv.

John xx. 193 which he also prescribed to his disciples‚
Luke x. 5. The Angel used this to Mary‚ which also was
the manner of the Gentiles, Hail, The Lord is with thee,
Luke i. 28.

But now when we salute absent persons by letters, the
forms of the antients were in the beginning of their Epis-
tles, grace, prosperity; at the end,fa7·ewell. But the Apos-
tles in each case, instead of these obsolete salutationis,
employed that more holy and august mode, Grace be wille
you, and peace from God our Fatlzer, and from the Lord Jesus
Chrz'st‚· or at least one like to it and equivalent. There-
fore to salute, under whatever form it be done, is to wish
these blessings to another from God the fountain of all

That this duty of kindly saluting others is not to be
neglected by a pious and Christian man, but is to be per-

faith and inflamed with love, they are acts pleasing to God,
and bring down the wished-for blessing (as often as sought)
upon the brethren. Lastly‚ if they are designedly neg-

and languishing3 from even the suspicion of which it be-
hoves all Christians to be free.

But here it may be objected3 these salutations seem to
be prohibited, as idle ceremonies‚ and to be held in con-
tempt by those who are engaged. When Elisha sent his
servant to raise the son of the vvidow, he sorbad him either
