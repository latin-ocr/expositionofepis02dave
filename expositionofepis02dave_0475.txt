phemer against Christ, that therefore a change took place
in God3 therefore, neither because at one time he was re-
concileable to God‚ at another time actually reconciled:
since to be justified and to be reoonciled to God are alto-
gether the same, or at least are inseparably connected.
But that we may remove this scruple more clearly, we must
observe, that although nothing absolute can anew be added
to God without his changing, yet infinite relative denomi-
nations may anew, and according to difference of time, at
one time be predicated of God‚ and at another time not be
predicated of hirn3 the Divine essence and will all the
while remaining without any shadow of turning. For those
things of a mutable and temporary kind which are affirmed
of God, are not so affirmed on account of any change⁴
taking place in God, but according to the change which
happens to the creature. For instance, It may be truly
said, That Adam was creatable by God, when it could·n0t
be truly said, ΤΙιαί Adam was created by God. In like man-
ner, Adam isjastg'fiable before God, or Adam ἐς reconcileable
to God, might be said before liis actual repentance, when
it could not be said, Adam is actuallyjustffied and reconciled
to God. Notwithstanding we do not apply to God acts
and powers, or any kind of mutability3 because these
things are spoken of God in a different way, not of any
change which takes place in himself, but of the change of
a creature, which is from him. For as Albertus learnedly
remarks, (Tract. 4. qu. 21, de Immutab. Dei.) In those
things wlziclz are done essentz'alZy, he acts in one way, and it is
not said, sliat lte acts ¹now ond not before, except so sar as he
has acted now ond noc before. Nor do we think that there is
any new or temporary act in the will of God, when we state
that he is actually reconciled to any man on believing, to
whom before believing he was only reeoncileable; because
God does not then begin to will that this believer should
be actually reconciled to him, who before he had faith was
reconcileable, but from all eternity willed that at that mo-
menthe should both believe and be actually reconciled.
In the Willer, then, there are not successive changes, but
