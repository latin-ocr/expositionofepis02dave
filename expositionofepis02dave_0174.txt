and to regard that in choosing a wife, which may and
ought especially to induce them constantly to love the
wife. And thus we have explained to you the precept
which enjoins love: Now we must proceed to the injunc-
tion, which forbids bitterness.

2. Be not bitter- ogainst tl1em.] The word is a metaphor,
drawn from unpleasant and bitter food, by the taste of
which men are offended. By this expression therefore, the
Apostle intimates, that the conversation of the husband
towards his wife ought to be pleasant and kind3 not unsa-
voury and harsh: Yea, (as says Ambrose in Hexaem. 5. 7.)
although naturally he may be rigid‚ yet lte ought to mite'gate
it by tlte very contemplation of marriage. Which also was
the opinion of the heathen : For (as Plutarch rel-ates) they

The bitterness here prohibited is wont to shew itself in
three things: the affections, the words, and actions.

l. First, in the very affections of husbands. For as
far as the affections are bitter‚ they who are exasperated
against their wives for light causes, and failures however
small, both begin from thence either to hate them, or

say any thing evil against their wives, yet often render the
fellowship of the conjugal state unpleasant and disagree-
able. That this bitterness is to be avoided, is gathered‚

l. From the precept itself of loving their wives, which
is imposed upon husbands: For it does not admit that ex-
ception, If they shall be, or whilst they shall be free from
all faults: For God‚ who gave this precept of loving the
wife, knew well that no mortal is free from his faults and
imperfectioris: Therefore by this truly impossible condi-
tion being added or understood, the precept would be su-
perfluous (and ridiculous). As, then, the. wife is bound to
obey ber husband, notwithstanding his many imperfec-
tions·‚ so also the husband is bound to love his wife. If
