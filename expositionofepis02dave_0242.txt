inore holy observation of the feast, and the participation
of the Lord’s supper. We shall bring some testimonies of
the Fathers. Ten-tullian, in 2 lib. ad uxorein, shews that
Christian women ought not to marry heathen husbands,
by the argument derived from these vigils: What hecttlzen,
says he, would willz'ngly bear tlzat lzz's wisi: should go from lzz's
sicle to these nocturnal convocatz'ons 52 Wlm will carelessly al·
low her to pass lter night in the Pascal solemnities? Before
they assembled at the vigils that they ‘were aecustomed to
sit up in the night, Athanasius also proves, Apol. ad Con-
stadt. where he complains that they were oppressed by the
Syrian president, for whilst they were intent upon prayer,
he sent his soldiers among them. Nazianzen mentions
these vigils, in Orat. 27, and Orat. 2. in Julian: and Ber-
nard, on the vigil of St. Andrew, says, He is an unworthy
man who does not observe tlte appointed abstz'nence of tlte vigil
with solemnjozs.

Now, besides these public vigils assigned to the public
assemblies of Christians, we may also observe that pious
and holy men sometimes spent sleepless nights in private
devotion, or applied most earnestly to prayer. Thus David
frequently affirms, that he even ceased not in the night
from prayer, Ps. xxii. 2, and lxxvii. 6. So Paul and Silas
shut up in prison, called upon God in the middle of the
night, Acts xvi. 25.

Concerning those publio vigils which necessity brought
upon the Church, we mention that one; the reason there-
of ceasing, they are now not improperly done away by
our Church: for that they would be liable to many disad-
vantages and dangers, no wise man will deny, who has sur-
veyed the manners of this age. Moreover it is gathered
from Canon 35 of the Council of Eliberisfit< that many in-

* This was the third Council of the Church in the fourth Century (for
the Council of Sinuessa, said to have been assembled on the alleged apostasy
of Marcellinus, ought not to be admitted in the number of Councils) said
to have been held at Eliberis or Elvira, now Granada, in Spain, about the
year 305. It passed 81 Canons touching such a variety of matters that it
„is supposed to have adopted several antient codes, or to have drawn into
one collection the Canons of the preceding Councils os Spain. The Canon
