Ver. 15. EPlSTLE To THE conossmNS. 123

rity, are doing no more than works of vanity: we must,
therefore, examine as to the moving principle, the order,
the object, the intention, &c-

·2. We may collect from the foregoing, that with how-
ever many virtues any one may seem to be adorned, he is
not clothed as becomes a son of God or a true Christian,
unless he shall have put on over the rest this garment of
charity.

3. Hence also we see the reason why the before-men-
tioned virtues, merc-is, lznmility, meelmess, long-sqffering, and
others, appear so seldom in common life3 namely, because
their parent charity has perished, as it is said in Matt. xxiv.
12, Because iniquity slzall abound, tlte love of many shall wax
cold. Α

Hence, lastly, we perceive that they who break the bonds
of charity, and afford occasion for schism, rend the integ-
rity and pei-fection of their mother the Church, and, as it
were, dislocate and tear her limb from limb. Thus much
concerning charity.

Verse 15.

And let tlte peace <ff God rufe in your hearts, to tlte wlzz'clc
also με are called in one body: (md be με tlzunlffzcl.

Ye have heard the Apostle's exhortation to put on cha-
rity. He now exhorts to two other virtues, which are
daughters, and, indeed, handmaids of charity3 for they
daily attend upon their mother, and cherish and preserve
her. One of these virtues he calls peace, the other is gra-
titade.

As to the former, three things occur to be observed,

1. Whence this peace hath its origin: viz. from God:
tlte peace of Gocl, ἃς.

2. What is its office, viz. to rule and preside in human
hearts : βραβευέτω.
