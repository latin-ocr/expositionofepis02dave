Ver. 2. E‘i‘lsrtr. ‘ro Tne cotossmns. 235

Wz'tlz thanksgz'ving] We come to the last condition
which is required in persons praying, and in prayer itself,
namely, graffitude, and thanksgiving flowing from thence.
And rightly indeed is thanksgiving coupled with prayer:
For in praying, whether we have respect to benefits already
received, or look forward to those to be received, whether
we consider those deferred, or altogether denied3 on all
these accounts we are bound to give thanks.

l. It is just that those seeking and expecting new be·
nefits should shew themselves grateful on account of those
before received: because, as even Aristotle rightly and
wisely observed, Ethic. 9, A return is required to preserve
jrz'emlslzip: but to God we have nothing that we can re-
turn except gratitude, Ps. cxvi. 12, leat ,shall [render
nuto the Lordsor all his benefits towatcls me? Ι will take the·
cup ofsalvation, ἃς.

2. We ought to shew ourselves grateful for benefits re-
ceived3 because in vain does he ask new benefits who
shews himself unmindful of those supplied3 lee hope oftlze
untltcmlcfid shall melt away as tlze winter's lzoarfrost, Wisd.
xvi. 29.

3. Thanks are even to be given for those deferred, yea,
for those denied. For when those things which we seek

are deferred, it is done that they may be conferred at the
most advantageous time for us 3 that we may esteem them

more when bestowed : when they are altogether denied, it
so happens, because God knew that those things would be
hurtful to us which we jndged for our advantage3 on the
contrary, that those would be as useful, which seemed to
us to be bitter and unpleasant. This is what Chrysostom
mammes, when he says, that we must lhanlc God, not only
for manifest benefits, butsor more leiddeu ones, wlzz'clz are afl-
forded us zmsolicited and in opposition to our desz'res- Of this
kind are sickness, poverty, persecution, and almost all
those things which are commonly thought hard to be en-
dured. And among these and the like, the opinion of
Augustine‚ in Epist. Joan. tract. 6, is to be received, who
asserts, that the pious and faithful, when they are not
heard according eo their will, yet are heard to their scffety.
