Ver. 7. EplsTLE 'ro THE COLosslANs. 271

that saying of the Apostle, 1 Thess. iv. 9, agrees in all the
truly pious, Concerm'ng brotherly love με have πο need that I

2. He is called afailhful minister] A double eulogy
is contained in these two words: he is extolled from his
honourable office, because α minister ; and from the faith-
ful execution of the same, because faithful in the mi-
nistry.

A Minister] namely, of Christ: for he speaks not of
any abject ministry, but of the ministry of the Gospel.
He is therefore named α minister for the sake of honour.
Hence learn,

1. That they are not to be reckoned among Christians
who despise men, otherwise not at all to be despised, on
the sole ground that they have undertaken the office of ’
a minister. For if to be a Christian, is a glorious thing3
then to be among Christians the leader of a faithful peo-
ple, the interpreter of the Divine will, a preacher of hea-
venly things, is by far the most glorious. Hence Paul, in
1 Tim. v. 17, assigned a double honour to the ministers of
the word, let them be especial& counted ωσι-ΠΨ qs double Ιιο-
nozer who labour in the word and doctrine.

2. That they are foolishly modest and unworthy the mi-
nistry‚ whom the profane folly of others either causes to
be ashamed or to repent of so honourable a vocation.
Paul was otherwise animated, who thought that he ho-
noured Tychicus by this title of a Minister, and com—
mended him to the Colossians; and who professed con-
cerning himself, Ι am not ashamed of the Gospel, Sto. Rom.
i. 16. And Gregory Nazianzen, Orat. 7, says, that it is
more excellent 1‘0 serve God in the sacerdotal office, than to bear
the pre-emz'nence among earllzly lcings.

3. That they also even sin on the opposite side, who
endeavour to transform this spiritual ministry into a tem-
poral empire. This the Romanists do, who constitute their
Pope, not a minister of the GospeL but a temporal nio-
narch of the whole world. Thus much of the office.

Faitly‘im] This adds much to the commendation ony-
chicus· For inasmueh as the ministry itself is to be ho-
