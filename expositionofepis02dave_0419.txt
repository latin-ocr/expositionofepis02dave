they do not seem to interpret so much as to ridicule this
generally received and most true decision of Divines, leat
Christ died for alt men sufficz‘ently, who transfer the term
sqffict'ently from the intention and act of dying to the mere
sufficiency or intrinsic value of the death considered in
itself; as if the sense were, The deatlz of Christ hatlz in

ARGUMENT 2. In this distinction of the Sohoohnen‚
which our people commonly admit, viz. leat Christ died
for all szfficz'ently, but for tlze predestz'nated ffectually‚ the
words sufficiently and effectually denote that which was
common to all men, whether elect or non-elect, in the
mode of the oblation, and that which was peculiar to the
elect alone. It was common to both, that Christ died or
was offered as a sacrifice to God the Father sufficiently for
them. But how can this first term sujjz'ciently be referred
promiscuously to the elect and the non-elect, if it marks
out a mere sufficiency of the thing, excluding the ordina-
tion of the same thing to individuals, which arises from
the intention and act of offering? Or, what need is there
of that other term effectually, to make a distinction in the
mode of the oblation‚ or in the intention of offering‚ as to
the elect and non-elect, if Christ had no intention at all of
offering himself up except for the predestinated alone?
This twofold distinction is evidently frivolous and vain,
where in things distinguished from each other, both parts
are not presupposed. It is therefore to be observed, that
the holy Fathers, when urging the universal sufficiency of
the death of Christ, do not stop at the mere sufficiency of
the thing, but at the act, intention, and mode of offering.
In this manner Athanasius* always speaks in his treatise
