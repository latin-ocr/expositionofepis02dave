216 AN EXPOSlTloN OF ετ. PAUL’s Clectpdv,

he bound them also by his precepts. Let us proceed to
the precept itself: of which there are two members:

]. Give ιιηίο your servants ίΙιαι which isjusl] τὸ δίκαιον,
that which isjust, in this place includes whatever is due to
servants from legal obligation, or according to positive
laws3 and excludes whatever is contrary to the same.
Aristotle, OEcon. i. 5, lays down three things as necessary
and due to servants, their work, their sustenance, their cor—
rection. We shall add also a fourth, viz'. their wages, which
is due to our servants, because they are not slaves, as
they were formerly among the antients. It pertains there-
fore to the justice of masters to render all these things to
their servants according to due measure : it is the part of
injustice, or at least of folly, if they deal otherwise with
them. For instance, in enjoining work upon a servant, he
observes justice who neither imposes immoderate labour,
nor suffers him to grow stupid in ease and idleness: So in
allowing them sustenance, he who neither withholds neces-
sary or convenient food, nor suffers them to indulge glut-
tony or drunkenness: In applying correction, he who does
not inflict punishment upon them with a cruelty exceeding
the extent of the fault, nor yet allows them to commit any
crime with impunity: In rewarding them, he who is neither
so sparing, that they cannot thereby procure for themselves
necessaries ; nor so lavish, as to yield them matter for dis-
soluteness. The Greek Scholiast thus expresses the whole
point3 It isjustice and equality to repay servantsfor their la-
bour, and to supply them wz'tlz an abundance qf all those things
necessaryfor them. The other branch of this precept fol-
lows :

2. Give mzto your servants that which is equal.] In the
Greek it is την ἰσότητα, equality or equ(1l)2'!z’ly. Which word
we must not take in that sense, as if it were incum-
bent upon masters to give to their servants the same ho-
nour, the same obedience, which they exact from them.
For well spake Plato, τοις ἀνίσοις ’τὰ ἲσα ’dm-a, διο. To give
equal things to unequals zs znequality.
