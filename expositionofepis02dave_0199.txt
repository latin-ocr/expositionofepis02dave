termine on these things which relate to their person and
condition. And if they may, yet this should always be
done with true obedience, and the honour due to parents,
which compels them to forego a cloistered life.

4. We'mnst obey God rather tlzan men‚· But God requires
α perfect life in all things ἱη general, Matt. xix„ and in par-
ticnlar‚ by inter-nal inspiration he calls certain persons: there-
fore is parents oppose, they are not to be listened to.

Answer, Bellarmin plainly dotes, who binds perfection
to a cloister and a hood. We place the perfectiori of a
Christian life in saith and charity, not in cereinonies or mo-
nastic rules. And we say with Gerson, That religious per-
formances, are improperly and abusively, aud perhaps arro-
gantly called α state (ff perfeccion. We therefore answer to
the argument, That all Christians ought to aim at spiritual
perfectiori, neither must parents be listened to, if they
endeavour to hinder the progress of their children in
faith and charity: but if they direct their children to
continue under their control, to remain with them at
home, to obey them in domestic duties, Ι affirm that law-
ful commands of this kind cannot be contemned without
the violation of the Divine command, and the work of
perfection is more excellent to obey parents in the fear of
Goel, than to subject themselves to monastic traditions.
