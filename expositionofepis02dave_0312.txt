302 AN EXPOSlTloN οῗι7 sT. PAUL’S Chap. iv.

But concerning this Epistle‚ Commentators have enter-
tained very different opinions. Theophylact would have
the first Epistle to Timothy to be understood, which is
reported to have been written from Laodicea. Marcion the
heretic thinks the Epistle to the Ephesians to be indicated 3
the title of which he dared impudently enough to interpo-
late, and to write upon it to the Laodiceam. Vide Tertull.
advers. Marcion, lib. 5.

Some of the advocates for the Papacy (among whom is
Stapleton*) think that some Epistle was written by the
Apostle to the Laodiceams, which yet the Chnrch by its
authority would not admit into the canon : and by this ar-
gument he attempts to prove that the canonical authority

* 8ΤΑΡιΕΤοΝ, Nomas, was born at Henfield, in Sussex, in 1535, and
educated at Canterbury and XVinchester Schools‚ and New College, Oxford.
In lilary’s reign he obtained a Prebend of Chichester, but on Elizabeth's
accession he retired with his parents to Louvahr, whither, after an excur-
sion to France and Italy, he returned, and made great progress in his stu-
dies. In 1569, Allen invited him to Douay, to found there his English se-
minary of idolatry and rebellion. He prosecuted this work so acceptably
that he was elected their Professor of Divinsty, took his degree of Doctor, and
was made afterwards Canon of the Collegiate Church of St. Amatus. He
had a great affection for the Order of Jesuits, and became a novice in it.
But he subsequently forsook them, and accepted an invitation to his old
station, Louvain, and the Professorship there, and obtained the lucrative
dignity of Dean of Hilverbeck. He became eminent as a Controversial-
ist on the side of the Romish Church, in favour of which he was an inde-
fatigable writer; and at his death in 1598, he left a number ofpieces‚ which,
together with his preceding works. were published collectively‚ at a great
expence, by the booksellers of Paris, in four thick vols. folio: 1620, the
contents of which are particularized by Dodd. This mass of learning
has been denominated Comus CONTOVERSIARUM. The renowned Car-
dinal Bellarmin is said to have been indebted to him for what he pub-
lished concerning the Church, Tradition, and Scripture. Clement the
VIIIth was so much delighted with the productioris of this zealous advo-
cate, that he ordered them to be read daily in times of his refection, and
invited him to Rome with a design to confer on him the place of Pro-
tonotary, and, as some say, to make him cardinal. All that is impor-
portant, however, in his “ vast stores‚'’ has been well and ably refuted by
thejustly celebrated Dr. Whitaker and others, (vide Note p. 135 of the
present vol.); and from the specimen here given by our Expositor‚ it may
be seen how easily the cobweb sophistry of the most renowned and best
educated champions of Popery is swept away, and all its pretty mechanism
reduced to a modicum of dirt- He who would have more of this writer
