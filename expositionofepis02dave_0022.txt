words3 and then shew the force of the argument, or the
consequence of the reason.

In the first place, then, it must be borne in mind, that
this is spoken of Christ properly and especially as to his
human nature, in which he rose, and ascended, and sits at
the right hand of the Father, as it is stated in the Apostle’s
Creed : and although as to the Divine nature, we must be-
lieve that he sat at the right hand of the Father from all
eternity‚ i. e· as Damascenus, Lib. 4. cap. 2, has expounded
it, that he had an equality of Divine Majesty with God the
Father: By the right hond (ff the Father we ‘mean the glor-1]
and honom¹ of the Godhead,· z'n which the Son of God existed,
before theworld began, as God, and of one substance with the
Father, but became incarnatae in these last days, and sittetlz
there bodily, his stesh being also glorffied. Therefore, pass-
ing by this Exposition of Damascenus, which respects the
Divine nature of Christ and his eternal Majesty, let us in-
quire what is intimated under the words to sit at the right
hand of God, when they are applied to the human nature of
Christ and its exaltation effected in time.

This is the sum; Since God hath no bodily right hand,
by this sitting is signified, that Christ as man, having ac-
complished the work of our redemption, is not only endowed
with immortality and perfect blessedness, but is raised to
heaven, placed above all creatures, Lord, Governor, and
Judge of the whole world, and especially constituted the
most glorious and powerful King and Patron ofthe Church.
Augustine, De fide et symbolo, Tom. 3, says, to sit, is to
possessjudicial power ; but lo be at the right hand cf God, is
to be in the highest blessedness ; as to be at the left hand is to
be in the deepest misery. But what it is for the man Christ
to sit at the right hand of the Father, is best explained by
the Apostle in Ephes. i. 20, 21, and 22. It comprises‚
then, the exaltation of the human nature to a state of the
completest happiness and glory of which it could be ca-
pable, and likewise exaltation and authority over all other
creatures.

The error of certain moderns is therefore to be avoided„
