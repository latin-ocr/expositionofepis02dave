imnost' affection of the heart: for he does not exclude the
voice, but advises that the affection of the beart be always
joined with the voice. And rightly indeed is a certain ar-

tians ought not to aim at promoting dissoluteness or gain 3
but to be employed in celebrating the praises of Christ the
Redeemer. We do not without cause. celebrate Christ as
true God in hynins, when the heathen are accustomed to
extol their false and senseless gods, Jupiter, Neptune,
Apollo, and the rest, in hymns: in this retaining, indeed,
a right opinion, because they judged this spiritual worship
to be rendered to the divine nature; but yet erring most
perniciously in that they enrolled these monsters of men in
