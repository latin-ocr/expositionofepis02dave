liet-e it, on account of the merits of Christ. In handling this
proposition we shall do two things. First‚ we shall ex-
plain some of the ternis. Secondly, we shall divide our
proposition into certain parts, and establish them sepa-
rately by some arguments.

In the first place, therefore, is to be explained, what we
mean by mere sufficienqy, and what by that which is com-
monly admitted by Divines, leac Christ died for all suffi-
cz'eutly. If we speak of the price of redempti0n‚ that ran-
som is to be acknowledged sufficient which exactly
answers to the debt of the captive3 or which satisfies the
demand of him who has the power of liberating the cap-
tive. The equality of one thing to another, or to the de-
mands of him who has power over the captive, constitutes
what we call this mere snfficiency. This shall be illustrated
by examples. Suppose my brother was detained in prison
for a debt of a thousand pounds. If I have in my posses—
sion so many pounds, Ι can truly affirm that this money is
suffic-ient to pay the debt of my brother, and to free him
from it. But while it is not offered for him, the mere.
sufficiency of the thing is understood, and estimated only
from th'e value of it, the act of offering that ransom being
wanting, without which the aforesaid sufficiency effects
nothing. For the same reason, if many persons should be
capitally condemned for the crime of high treason, and the
king himself against whom this crime was committed
should agree that he would be reconciled to all for whom
his son should think fit to suffer death : Now the death of
the Son, according to the agreement, is appointed to be a
sufficient ransom for redeeming all those for whom it should
be offered. But if there should be any for whom that ran-
som should not be offered, as to those it has only a mere
sufficiency, which is supposed from the value of the thing
considered in itself, and not that which is understood from
the act of offering. To these things I add, lf we admit
the aforesaid ransom not only to be sufficient from the
equality of one thing to the other, and from his demand,
who requires nothing more for the redemptiou of the cap-
tives; but also to be greater and better in an infinite de-
