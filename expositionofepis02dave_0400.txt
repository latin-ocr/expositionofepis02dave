dain a benefit or reinedy applicable to every individual,
which, nevertheless, on account of the wickedness or
unbelief of men, he cannot apply to many of them.
REPLY 13. In order to remove these scruples it should
be attentively notice‹l‚ that we defend this proposition
only, That there is some kind of ordination or good plea-
sure of the Divine will, according to which the death of
Christ is a satisfactory ransom in such a manner applicable
for all men to the-obtaining of reniission, that if they
should submit themselves to this ordination and good plea-
sure, it would be actually applied to each and every man.
But we do not assert or maintain the proposition, That
there is any ordination, good pleasure, or decree of the
Divine will, according to which he should absolutely in-
tend or appointto make this death of Christ to be effectu-
ally and infallibly applied to each and every inan. The
former ordination considered in itself is sufficient for the
purpose, that the death of Christ may be truly said to be
applicable to all men individually3 since the want of such
an ordination is the reason why we cannot say that Christ
died for the apostate angels‚ or that the death of Christ is
not applicable to them in any degree. These things being
premised, Ι affirm that the consequence of the major is
invalid. For although the death of Christ, according to
the ordination and will of God himself, is a remedy of
such a kind that it may be applied to any individua] of the
human race for salvation, and the mode of its application
is clearly laid down in the holy Scripture, namely, through
the performance of the condition of faith3 yet it cannot
be inferred from thence, either that faith or salvationis
infallibly to be conferred on all and each one; because it
is a very different thing to ordain the death of Christ as a
remedy applicable for salvation to all men, and to prescribe
saith as the mode or condition by which it is applied3 and
to appoint and absolutely to decree effectually to produce
saith and salvation in certain persons. This latter, there-
fore, cannot be rightly deduced from the former. For as
if God should create any herb endued with such a virtue
that it might heal any one who labours under any disease
