things, being certain to obtain them at last, if we seek
them as we ought to do.

Τὰ ἀνω φρονεῖτε, Mind the things above, think upon or savour
them] The word φρονεῖτε, in our translation sec your-office-
te'ons, embraces two acts3 the act of the mind or of the
understanding reflecting about any thing3 and the act of
the will and affections approving and loving any thing:
Therefore, the Apostle would have us raise our minds to
heaven, and perpetually have those things above at heart3
neither that alone, but that we should ardently love those

things, and fix our affection upon them. Unless we join ²

these two, no one will prepare to seek heavenly things3
for there is 710 desire <ff α thing unknown.- it is, therefore, ·
necessary to know, and frequently to revolve in'mind, these .
heavenly things3 for no one seeks that about which he
thinks not: But neither is it sufficient to think, unless it
is done with love and affection3 for nothing is sought by
us except that which is desired and loved. Bernard truly
observed, The understanding and the affection in men are
sometimes opposed to each other, so that the one knows and ap· >¹
proves the things which are above, although the other is found
to desire the things on the earth. When that happens, the
mind is distracted and torn away, not excited to seek.
Hence it is that Paul exhorts us not only to know, but to
vsavour the things which are above.

Hence we leam: ,

always to have in mind that heavenly kingdom, and those
heavenly good things which relate to the attainment of it.
We observe this in Abraham, the father of the faithful, of
whom the Apostle testifies, Heb. xi. 10, that he loolcedfor α
city which hathjbzmdations. This we read of the Christians
of the primitive Church, who had this kingdom above so
frequently in their minds and discourse, that from thence
they fell under the suspicion, among the heathen, of aiming
at the sovereignty. Just. Martyr. Apol. 2. ad Antoninum.

2. It is also their duty who hope they shall obtain eter-
nal blesseduess, to order the course of their life according
to heavenly considerationsg ancl to judge of all matters
