of this ransom is worthy of observation. It was so paid
to God that it could not redeem devils, even if they might
be supposed to believe3 because it was not paid for them ;
but it was so exhibited and given by God, that it might
redeem any of the human race, if they would believe;
whence could this be, unless it was offered and paid for
them? For it could not avail for the deliverance of any
persons whatsoever, even if they should believe, unless it
were supposed to be given and offered by God for them in
a general view of the human race, even when they did not
believe. Having, therefore, established this distinction
between the sufficiency of the death of Christ as to men
and as to devils, namely, that the death of Christ is un-
derstood to be sufficient for all men in the same sense as it
is rightly denied to be sufficient for the fallen angels, let us
pass from this major proposition to the minor. Ι say, then,
if we do not acknowledge any other sufficiency in the
death of Christ as to the redemption of all mankind, ex-
cept that which we have called mere sufficiency, and which
has respect to th'e intrinsic value of the ransom, the ordi-
nation of the offering as to individuals being disregarded—
there is no distinction made between such persons and the
devils themselves as to the right of obtaining pardon and
remissiori by means of this ransom, which was mentioned
above by Arnbrose, and granted to men universally, but
denied to angels. It is clear, because the value of the death
of Christ is estimated from the dignity of the sufferer: it
therefore had in itself‚ intrinsically, not only a sufficiency,
but an infinite superabundance, even if there should be
placed in the other scale the sins, not only of all mankind,
but of the fallen angels. There is therefore to be granted,
with respect to mankind, not only that mere sufficiency‚
which depends upon the inherent dignity of the thing of-
fered, but that ordained sufficiency which arises from the
intention and act of Christ referring this his passion to all
mankind, and not referring it to the fallen angels. This
being granted, Christ is truly said to have died for all men
sufficiently with that sufficiency which does not exist with
