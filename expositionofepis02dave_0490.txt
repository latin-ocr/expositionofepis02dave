trary. From whence it appears That the reason of the dif-
ference why God grants his grace to one and not to another,
ought to be referred to the good pleasure of God himself,
and not to the different kind of operations of nien.
ARGUMENT 2. Secondly‚ we prove, that it is not con-
trary to the Divine goodness, even admitting the death of
Christ, still not to grant the means of application to all
men whatsoever according to his good pleasure: because
the death of Christ is a benefit granted Freer by God him-
self to the human race. But it is just and right that the
free application of his own benefit should be in the power
of the Benefactor, who is never bound by the giving of
one benefit to the giving of another, unless he should have
made such a promise3 which promise of granting the
means by which the death of Christ may be applied, nei-
ther can all nien promiscuously, nor any person for
himself individually, rightly assert was made. More-
over‚ it is no reflection on the Divine goodness not to
grant any benefit to one, if he does not bring an injury
upon any one, or unjustly deny to or deprive any one of a
benefit due to him3 but illuminatior] by the grace of the.
Gospel, the death of Christ being supposed, yet is not
due to nature, now corrupted by sin. Thus Bannes
says (In. l, qu. 23, art. 3, p. 279) The same argument is
not applicable to naturaland supermztural illzmzinatz'ma, because
that which is natural is due to nature, but tlie illeamz'natz'on of
grace is not clue to nature, especially as z't is so corrupted by
sin, bus is coiffierred by grace. If it is conferred by grace,
thenit is not due to all. For among the twelve articles
which pertain to the Christian saith, Augustine has put
this second (Epist. 107), The grace qs Gocl is not given to all
men. If it is conferred of grace, then it is not given or
denied according to the good or bad use of natural light3
for, as Prosper rightly remarks, (Resp. 8, ad Capit. Gallor.)
It z's impiety to affirm that the grace by which we are saved is
either given in paymeutfor meritorz'ous cleeds or restrained by
evil ones. And, (De Vocat. Gent.) There are 110 wickednesses
so detestable as to drive away tlze gift ofgrace. Those there-
fore who are desirous of defending the justice and good-
