contrary event of things. For if he speaks of repentance,
which remission of sins and eternal life follows, that invi-
tationflor calling is not apt or sufficient in itself for such
repentance, which does not send the penitent to Christ.
But that which sends the penitent to the death of Christ
for the expiation of the sins of men, is altogether un-
known out of the Church‚ where the Gospel of Christ is
not known. Therefore an invitation and calling apt and
sufficient sor saving repentance is not given to all men.
Moreover, neither ought this opinion to be approved,
That God by his universal grace grants to all men individually
tlzat they may be saved ij they wisl. For first, it is foolish
to assert, That infants. who are born the children of wrath,
and die out of the Church‚ can be saved if they wi113

But Ι ask, as to adults, what is this, That every indivi-

may be saved, who are rightly willing to believe in Christ3
but I also assert, that every individual who thus believes
cannot be damned. Yet Ι add, that universal grace is not
proved by a power of obtaining salvation, conceived by
those who are in a state not yet purified, nor ever to be
purified. It is therefore evident, that the condition, If
they are willing to believe in Christ, cannot be fulfilled by
many, unless God wills to send to them preachers of the
Gospel. (Rom. x. 14, 15.) For as no one can see a vi-
sible object when it is absent, so when a credible object
is absent, no one can exercise the act of believing. There
are, therefore, multitudes who cannot be saved, because
they cannot believe in Christ. They cannot believe in
Christ for obtaining remission of sins, because the act of
