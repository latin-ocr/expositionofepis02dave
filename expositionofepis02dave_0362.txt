352 A mssERTATmN oN THE DEATH OF CHRlST,

a diminishing term, nor does it take away the truth of the
thing affirmed. But more will be said respecting this,
when we come to our second proposition. Hitherto we
have contended from the testimonies of Scripture. Next
we shall from certain arguments very solidly founded (as
it appears to us) in the Scriptures. ’

1. That death which brings some spiritual advantages
evento those who are not saved, is not applicable to the
elect alone: but the death of Christ brings advantages
even to some who will not be saved. F'or the clearer un-
derstanding of the major, Inow add that which Ι men-
tioned in the beginning, That under the name of the death
qf Christ, we include all that accumulation of the merito-
rious obedience of Christ, to which his death put as it were
the last finish. For it is this infinite merit of the Mediator
Christ, which God the Father beholds, when he bestows
any spiritual benefit upon lost and miserable mortals in

applied to some who will not be saved. Let us proceed‚
then, to the proof of the minor, which alone can be
doubted. In the first place, I ask, is it not to be esteemed
of considerable advantage, that God should deign to call
many even of the non-elect to repentance and saith, and,
under the condition of faith, to eternal life? It is es-

of the Gospel, the word qf' life, (John vi. 68, Acts v. 20)
the grace of God wlzz'clz bringellc salvation (Tit. ii. ll). Who
says, It behoved Christ to suff'er, and to rise from the dead tlte
tlzird day, that repentance and remissiori of sins should be
preaclzed in his name among all nations (Luke xxiv. 46, 47).
Who, lastly, calls this preaching of the Gospel, α treasure
(2 Cor. iv. 7), and pronounces the feet of them that preach
the Gospel beautfful (Rom. x. 15), and threatens the taking
it away as the greatest punishment (Matt. xxi. 43), and
declares that they shall be most severely punished who
