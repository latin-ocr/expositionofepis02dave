indiviclual os mankind. This proposition is first to be ex-
plained, then to be confirmed by testimonies and argu-
ments, and lastly, to be defended against the objections
which are brought against it. With respect to the expla-
nation. of the terms, when we speak of tlze death of Christ,
we comprehend in it the whole obedience of Christ, active
and passive, the completion of which, and as it were the
last act, was effected in his death; on which account
Divines are accustomed by synecdoche to attribute to his
death what relates to his entire obedience. VVhatever
therefore Christ did, and whatever he suffered, from the
cradle to the cross, the whole of the meritorious and sa-
tisfactory work of the Redeemer we comprehend in our
proposition to be allied to and connected with his death.
Thus the Apostle, in Rom. v. 19, makes tlte obedience ⁰f
Christ, universally considered, the cause of man's salvass
tion, By tlte obedience of one shall many be made riglueous.
And in Phillip. ii. 7, 8, when it is said, ,That lte lzumbled
himself and became obedient unto death, even the death qs tlze
cross, the Apostle does not exclude from his meritorious
work any part of the antecedent obedience of Christ, but
rather considers it included, and teaches that this merito-
rious obedience of Christ began at that time when he took
the form of a servant, and was consummated when he of-
fered himself on the cross. Under the word death, then,
we comprehend that infinite treasure of merits which the
Mediator between God and men, the man Jesus Christ, by
doing and suffering, procured and laid up for our benefit.
Again, when we say that this death or this merit is repre·
sentecl in tlze hely Scriptures as tlze universal cause of salva-
tion, we mean, That according to the will of God explained
in his word, this remedy is proposed indiscriminately to
every individua] of the human race for salvation, but that
it cannot savingly profit any one without a special applica-
tion. For an universal cause ‹gfsalvatium or an universal
remedy, includes these two things: first, that of itself it
can cure and save all and every individual : secondly, that
for the production of this determinate effect in each indi-
vidual it should require a determinate application. Not
