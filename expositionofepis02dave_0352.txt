342 Α DissEstTArioN οΝ THE DEATH or cnmsr,

unaptly‚ therefore, did Aquinas say, The death of Christ is
tlze universal cause (f salvation, as the sin of tlzefirst man
may be said to be tlte universal cause of damnation. But it is
necessary that an universal cause should be applied particularly
to eaclz individual, that its proper effect may be experienced.
Further, what we maintain iu our proposition, that this
universal cause of salvationis applicable to all and every
individual of mankind, at once excludes the apostate angels,
to whom (whatsoever may be thought of the intrinsic va-
lue and sufficiency of this remedy) according to the re·
vealed will of God, its universality is not extended. Nor
even with respect to men can it be extended so universally
as to be applicable to every one under every state and cir-
cumstance. For it is not applicable to the dead or the
damned, but to the living: nor to the living under every
condition, but under the conditions ordained by God. The
death of Christ was not applicable to Peter for salvation,
ff Peter had persisted in (levying Clu-ist to the last. And
the same death of Christ was capable of application to·
Judas, ff Judas lzad repented and believed iti Christ. For
this cause, therefore, we have not merely said that it is
applicable to all and every individual of mankind, but on
this being added, from the ordination of God, and the
nature of tlze thing. For there is in the Gospel a certain
ordination of God, according to which the death of Christ
is applicable to all and every living man3 which cannot be
truly affirmed of demons or the damned. To this those
words in the conference at the Hague seem to relate, in
which the Contra-remonstrants endeavoured to shew some
difference between the state of the devils and certain un-
believers. For tlze devils, they say, α Mediator was noc
given or ordoffled, butjbr men (page 154). A little after,
Utebelievers, although they bave deserved condenmatz'on. yet
there is ac present some way and means tlzrouglz wlzicli tlzey
may avoid it, namely, 'ff tlzey should believe (page 155).
