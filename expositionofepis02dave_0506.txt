496 A nissam-arion ON THE DEATH or cniusr.

one of his absolute or mere good pleasure. Thus the Re-
monstrants‚ in the declaration of their opinion about the
third article of the Acts of the Synod of Dort‚ (p. 15) say,
That tlte sarving efficacy (ff grace depends not on the congrui&
of the calling (ff God (as some Papists assere), nor on the
omnipotem power of G0d‚ as Prosper (Carin. de Ingr. cap.
14 and 15) and Angustiae affirm, (Contr Julian. lib. 5, cap.
33 De praed. Sanct. cap. 23 De grat. &a libr. arbit. cap. 20,
and De corrept. Sc grat. cap. 14) but on such cm operation as
produces its effect most certainly, when man does not oppose that
rebellion, which lze can oppose from himself. As if they
should say, that grace is effectual in certain individuals‚
because they do not oppose any obstacle to it, when they
ought to say, that the reason why an obstacle is not op-
posed is, because God of his own good pleasure has given
effectual grace. l now add a minor, and affirm that it is
altogether averse from theology and from truth, to contend
that any decree is established by the death of Christ, ac-
cording to which the certain procuring of grace and salva-
tion is referred, not to the absolute will of God, but to the
determination of the human will. For the method of ob-
taining or not obtaining salvation, 'which is resolved into
the freedom of the human will, was the first grace, which
was given to the first Adam, as Augustine has rightly ob—
served, (De corrept. Sc grat. cap. ll and 12) buc chat is far
more powetful which is given in Christ to all who are saved,-
from wlzz'clz it arises that they should be willing and only wil-
ling, in order really to overcome the reluctant will of theflesh.
Therefore, after Christ is given to us, this distinction, that
some have that grace by which they apply Christ to them-
selves for salvation, and others have it not, is to be refer-
red, not to the difference of human wills, but to the good
pleasure of the will of God.

ARGUMENT 8. Our last argument is derived from the
testimonies of the Fathers, who willingly confess, that to
some persons, and that according to the good pleasure of
the Divine will, those means and gifts are not granted, by
which they may be able to believe in Christ and obtain
salvati0n3 which God would never omit to do, if, the death
