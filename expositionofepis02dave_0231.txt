they imagine that they alone are servants only, that them-
selves are absolute masters, and nothing else but masters.
They are commanded, therefore, to know and remember,
that they also are servants of the same supreme Master,
and on‘that account fellow-servants with their servants:
Now it is far from reason, that a servant, although a little
more honourable, should act unjustly and tyrannically with
his fellow servants3 because he would not like that God
himself should act in the same manner towards him.

would indicate what sort of a Master masters themselves
also have ; viz. an lzeavenly one, i. e. just, almighty, omni-

country. Since, however, this heavenly Master is never
absent from us, it is never safe to act frowardly.

Secondly, because this heavenly Master is holy and just,
and hates all injustice. Earthly masters, indeed, some-
times either countenance the wickedness of servants, or at
least wink at it3 because they themselves are equally wick-
