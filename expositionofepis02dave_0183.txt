Ver. 20. EPISTLE το THE corossmns. 173

father cannot recal his son from the army of his earthly
king by any authority with which he is invested, how much
less from this sacred army 2 Nay, they who have put their
hands to this work ought not to look back to that which
they have left, Luke ix. 62.

The reason is similar in regard to those who discharge
public offices: for it is just that private concerns yield to
public ones. To conclude in a word : A son can never be
freed from the duty of honouring and succouring his pa-
rents3 buthe may from the duty of dwelling with them,

was it concealed from the heathen themselves, that the life
of those who conducted themselves piously and dutifully
towards their parents was prolonged by the Divine gift.
Whence that remark of the Greek poet 3 Be assur-ed t'lmt by
bonnm-ing your parents you will flourislz in the world: and
another to the same purport; lou will live long enough, ff
