perity give themselves to ease 3 but under the cross despond
through indolence of mind, or through impatience rage
against God and men, and in the mean time are intent
upon no good thing. It is not to be desired that all the
affairs of these men should be made known to the people,
as what would be rather a scandal to them than acom-

as he could, to furnish himself with particular knowledge
of each individual. Thus every minister ought to labour,
not only in feeding his flock, but also in inquiring into and
discerning their manners.

3. Hence let us observe the wisdom of Paul: For he
