that in shewing the opinion of the Semipelagians, many
things are joined together by Prosper and Hilary‚ some of
which agree with the nuth, and others savour of error.
What therefore'they relate, that the Semipelagians de-
clared that all men sinned in Adam, and that our Lord
Jesus Christ died for the whole human race, and some

We assert therefore, that Augustine never attempted to

the elect by a singular gift of mercy, and does not arise
from the good use of free-will in the one rather than in the
other. Herc the controversy directly regards the grace of
