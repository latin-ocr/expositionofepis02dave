Chapsti. As THE UN1VERSA1. cAusE OF SALvA‘rioN. 363

‘that' the death or merit of Christ, in his infinite mercy, ought
to be considered as a thing determined on and destined for
men before saith is destined for any individual persons.
Which appears, in the first place, because the death or
merit os Christ is the object of faith. But to what pur-
pose would have been the gift of faith to Peter or Paul,
unless a saving remedy had first been ordained applicable
to any one through faith‘? Further, faith, like all other
saving gifts, is conferred upon men on account of Christ
and through his merit; therefore, in the order of the Di-
vine decrees, the death of Christ precedes the saith of
every Christian. To this those words of the Divines of
the Palatinate refer, in their judgment exhibited at the
Synod of Dort (Art. Synod. Dordrecht. page 88), Thefaz'th
of' the elect does not precede, hut follows the death of Christ,
because his death is the cause fffaitlz, οη account of which
the electore given to Christ, and the object offaz'th, which it
beholds and embraces. Finally, it is decreed, that through
the death of the second Adam, salvation is procurable for
all men who are lost in the first Adam, before it is de-
creed to whom it may be given effectually and infallibly,
and to whom it may not be given. It is to be confessed‚
therefore, that the Mediator Jesus Christ, with his death
and the infinite treasure of his merits‚ is, from the ordina-
tion of God, applicable for salvation to the whole human
racc, although the most free, most just, most secret good
pleasure of God intervenes, according to which he deter-
mines that saith (through means of which application is
made) should be infallibly given to certain persons and not
given to others. But why, in dispensing the treasure of
the merits of Christ, which is sufficient for and applicable
to all men individually, he acts so unequally with persons
in equal circumstances, we ought not to inquire, since we
cannot ascertain‚ but with 'the Apostle acquiesce in the
secret will of God, He laath mercy on whom he will lzave
mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. Romans ix. 18.
No one hath first given to him, that it should be recompensed
‚wzto him again. Romans xi. 35.
