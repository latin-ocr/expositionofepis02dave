152 ΛΝ ΕΧΡοειτιοΝ or ST. mut's Clmp. iii.

cause the affection of the husband for the most part de-
pends on the due subjection of the wife: for if she yield
her subjection, unless he is dead to all moral sensibility,
he cannot but return his love. But let us come to the
words of the Apostle.

We have in this eighteenth verse, ]. Α proposition3 2.
A limitation of the proposition. This is the proposition,
Wives ought to be seelgject to their husbands. The limitation,
or mode of subjection is, As it isfit iu t'lze Lord.

In the proposition itself we shall briefly treat these four
things. First, what subjection is considered in a general
point of view. Secondly, in what things this particular
subjection of wives towards their husbands consists.
Thirdly, what are the reasons impelling women to yield
this duty of subjection. Fourtffly, what may be the impe-
diments or obstacles, that this bounden duty should not be
performed by them: for both these ought to be known that
they may be avoided and removed.

1. The subjection, then, osone creature to another in
general, is nothing else, if it be considered on the part of
God, than a Divine disposition, whereby the more imper-
fect are subordinate to the more perfect, that by this sub-
jection the former may be perfected, governed‚ and pre-
served hy the latter. If it be considered on the part of the
creature subjected, then the virtue of subjectior] is its ready
inclination to obey this ordinance constituted by God him-
self.

*We see without this appointed subjectior} neither natural
affairs, nor political societies, nay, not even the world
itself could consist. All earthly and sublunary thIngs are
subject to celesti-al ones3 for since they are in their nature
more imperfect and ignoble, they cannot attain to their
perfection without this natural subjection. So in political
societies, government and subjection are accounted not
only among the things that are useful, but among the
things plainly necessary* Hence citizens are subject to
magistrates, soldiers to their commanders, for their good
