their own will. (Lib. l, de Grat. & lib. arbitr. cap. 12)
He rejects the opinion of those who teaclz llzat it is in tlte
power qs men to malfe that grace effectual, which otherwise
would not of z'lself be more tlzan sufficient. He shews that
they oppose Augustine and the holy Scriptures, who say,
that all men would receive the grace of God, z'f those to whom

And further, he urges his opinion with this objection, Thac
if effeccual calling did not clepend on the purpose of God, but

bad use of their free-will in exciting‚ exnbracing, or repel-
ling grace, and salvalion was given to those who were 'millia-g
to be savedfrom the fbuntaz'n (ff their own mining, as Prosper
sang, (lib. de Ingratis‚ cap. 6.)

against those who endeavour to limit it, That it was a kind
of universal covenant‚ established with the whole human
race‚ concerning the giving of remissiori and eternal life to
