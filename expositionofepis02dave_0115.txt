Ver. 12. Eris‘rLE To Tun COLOSSMNS. 105

have their bowels of mercy closed too, or rather they have
none. But we shall also adduce some motives for this
lse'ndness or liberality,

The first shall be what ought to prompt us to all good
w01·ks,‘the command of God and our Lord. For it is not
the case (as the vulgar vainly imagine) that works of jus-
tice alone fall under the precept, and works of mercy
are left to our own will. God distinctly requires of us
works of beneficence‚ and severely punishes their omis-
sion. Brealc tlzy broad with the lzungry, Isa. lviii. 7. See
Matt.xxv- 41, 42, &Q

Secondly, the duty of dispensing their wealth is irnposed
upon all the rich. Hence benevolence towards the poor is
called righteousness, Prov. xi. 18. And they are reproached
with theft by the Famem, who, when they might, assist'
not the poor. Hence that charge of Basil : lee bread wlzz'ch,
you we'thhold is the broad of your servant ; the gar-ment ughiclz
you keep is the garment (ff tlze nakecl ; and the money you lay
up is tlte money of tlze poor. And Gregory Nazianzen‚ Orat.
16, says, May ic ποί be my uulzappy lot to grow riclz while tlte
poor are in want, and I not succour tlzem in their distress,
&c.

Thirdly. A reward is promised by God to those who are
beneficent towards the poor: A reward, I say, both in this
life and in the life which is to come. That it is in this life
see Ps. cxii. 5, &Q Prov. xi. 25, and xxviii. 27. For that
which is to come, see Matt. xxv. 34, Luke xiv. 14, Gal. vi.
9. The testimonies of the Fathers to this are very numer-
ous3 and hence the exhortations to benevolence. We lose
all eartlm'y things by keeping them ; we preserve them by giv-
ing, says Greg. Hom. 17. in Evang. lt z's gain to give to tlze
poor, says Basss, Serm. 1, in Avaros. leyfearest tlzou to
render everlasting thy fraz'l ared transitory goods, or to encrust
thy treaszeres to God’s scgfe keepz‘ng? asks Lactantius, lib. 6.
cap. 12. And Jerom, ad Nepotian says, I do not remember
to have read of an unlmppy death of any one who lead liberally
exetcised the work-s of clearily ; sor such an one lcas many in-
{arcessor-s.
