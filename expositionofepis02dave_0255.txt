mystery of Christ. The people should desire to hear
nothing else, the minister should preach nothing else, than
the mystery of Christ, that is, the doctrine of salvation
obtained through Christ.

For which Ι am in bonds] These words are inserted by
the way, but not unnecessarily: for they have their use,
whether you look to the people, or the pastors.

1. They excite the people to love this Apostle, who,
