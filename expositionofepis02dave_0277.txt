Ver. 7. Epls'rLE To 'rnE COLOSSIANS. 267

As to the causes of his missi0n3 the first is gathered
from these words, All my slate shall he declare unco you:
that is, he shall shew you all things about which you
ought to be informed. Paul was separated from the Co-
lossians' by a long distance, inasmuch as he was imprison-
ed at Rome, and, as it were, destined to the lions: On
account of their love, therefore, towards such an Apostle,
they desired doubtless to know how he did, what sufferings
he was labouring under, what danger threatened him, what
hope ofdeliverance there appeared, and other things of
the kind. Therefore, willing to satisfy this so becoming a
desire, he deputed Tychicus and Onesimus, who might

Hence we may observe,

wonder, therefore, if he who could do such remarkable
things under his confinement, should wish his affairs to be
known to·them.

3. A Christian people, therefore, is to be blamed, to
whom it is no pleasure to see the prosperity of their minis-
ters 3 neither feel any sympathy in looking upon their mi-
series: who only care about their own things, but with
regard to their ministers‚ what they want or what they
suffer, they are no ways solicitous about. The Colossians
were otherwise minded, who earnestly desired to know all
Paul's concerns.

4. Ministers also are to be reprehended, who do not so
conduct themselves in every condition and fortune, that it
may be well for their people to know what they do and
what they suffer. Of this class are they, who in pros-
