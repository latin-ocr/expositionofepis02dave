it is by no means on that account not to be regarded as a
siu: for, by the confession of the Orator, Cic. De legib.
l, so corrupting is the habit ο] evil that by it the small sparlcs
z‘ssiced from nature are extinguishecl, and contrary vices spring
up. But neither do we admit, that fornication was not
condemned by the wiser Heathens. Alcmena in Plautus
says, With a woman whom thou judgest to be imnzodest thou
wilc not converse, either in jest or in earnest, unless thou be
the most foolish eff all 'men- Tacitus also observes, There is
nothing pure in ιι. mind corrupted [gy lust.

3. It is objected‚ Sin cannot come by a Divine com-
mand3 but God commanded Hosea the prophet, Go lohe
unco thee a wffe (ff whorecloms, and malfe to thyself children
of whorccloms, &a Cap. i. ll. It is not a sin, therefore,
to commit fornication.

Ι answer, the wordfac, make, which is added in the
Vulgate version, is neither in the Hebrew, nor the Greek;

If we assert with Origen, Jerome, the Chaldae paraphrast,
Tremellius, and many others, that this was done in vision
only, then it is altogether irrelevant to the point. If we
admit with Irenaeus, Basil, Augustine, Cyril, and others,
that it was done in reality3 yet it argues nothing in defence
of fornication: for the prophet was not commanded to
commit fornication, but to take to himself a wife formerly
addicted to fornication. Hence says Augustine, versus
Faustus, lib. 22, cap. 80, What is there, Ι asle, z'm'mz'cal fo
the Christian saith, 7] α hamt, abandoning her sornication,
becomes a chaste zeffe ‚9 But that which follows in the Vul-
gate version, and make to thryself children (ffsornication, is
not repugnant to this opinion, which supposes the prophet
to have married this prostitute : for either those were called
children of fornication whom she had had before, as ap-

pears from the original context3 or, if it be referred to
