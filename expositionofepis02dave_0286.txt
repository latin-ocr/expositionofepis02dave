276 AN EXPOSITION or ει rAut's Chap. iv.

this man, yet it conduces something to inflame the Colos-

sians with the love of him: for what is a person's own and

is peculial* to him, is wont to be more loved by every one.
Observations.

1. It is proper to treat them with peculiar affection, to
whom we are more near and bound in any peculiar respect3
for example, if they should be of the same blood, affinity,
or country with us, or of the same society.

2. That affection, therefore, is vicious, which in many
begets contempt, or at least, a neglect of their own,
namely, because they are of our kin. For as in things, so
also in persons3 the things which are produced at home
are nearest to dis-esteem, but all distant and foreign things
are extolled with wonderful encomiums. Christ himself
experienced this folly of his own countrymen, and seriously
complained of it, Matt. xiii. 57, A prophet is not without
honour, saveia ln's own country andin leis own house. And
thus much of the person extolled, and of his commenda-
tion. Now as to the cause why he also had been sent to
the Colossians together with Tychicus, this he shews in
these last words 3

They shall make known to you all things which cere done
heren] Now he had said concerning Tychicus, All my state
shall he declare mzto you : But because men are wont not so
firmly to believe a single witness, he would make them
more certain of all his affairs by the testimony of two,
that there might be no room left for doubt. It is not ne-
cessary to explain this in more words, because we have
spoken of this same occasion at the seventh verse.

We have now finished the two former parts of this Chap-
ter; the first of which consisted in exhortati0ns3 the other
in commendations ε The third and last part remelius, which
is taken up with salutations.
