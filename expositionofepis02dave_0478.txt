Osssec‘rioN 4. Some passages may be produced from
the Scriptures which seem to essert, as to the elect, actual
and eternal reconciliation with God before their saith and
repentance. Ephes. i. 4, God is said to have chosen them
before thejoumlation of the world, and ver. 6, to have made
them accepted z'n his beloved Son. They were therefore elect-
ed, and actually justified and reconciled, from eternity3 for
although their reconciliation was madeon the partos God
when they believed the Gospel, yet that rather then began
to be manifested and revealed which had been done from
the foundation of the world·

Rssptv. Itis one thing to choose a person to life before
the formation of the world, another thing actually tojus-
tify and reconcile him to himself before the formation of
the world. Election bespeaks in God an eterna] will of
justifying‚ reconciling', and saviug the person elected; but
of justifying, reconciling‚ aud saving him in his own time
by faith. Therefore, the actual justification, reconcilia-
tion, and sanctification of the person elected, flows from
eternal election, but is not co-eternal with it. It is easy

be holzs (md without blame before him in love. Nor does he
teach us, that by virtue of eternal election we were'justi—
fied or reconciled from eternity, but in tlte dispensatiore (ff
tlaesuluess of times, (ver. 9, 10, διο.) after havingfirst trusted
in Christ, and believed the Gospel which was made known
to us. Nor are the words, He hatti made usum-epted in his
beloved Son, opposed to this idea3 for the Greek word
εχαριτωσεν seems to refer rather to the present state of the
elect now regenerate, than to the eternal purpose of God-
From whence Beza translates it, Freely he made them accept-
able to himself, namely, he freely justified them and admit-
ted them ou believing into a state of actual reconciliation.
But if any one interprets that accc’ptance as relating to the
eternal love of God, by which he embraces the elect before
