though lhe word of' the cross z's not preached every where, yet
God z's ready to announce z't to all those who duly submit them-
selves to the ministry of the law, that is, who follow the light
(ff the law (ff nature, which flourishes even in the hearts of hea-
thens. And discoursing of natural gifts (p. 118) he says,
That God has left these gffts to the Gentiles, that is, according
to the intention (ff God, they should use those gffts to glorify
God, according to the measure of their knowledge, they should
be led to Christ and the knowledge of himself ; but on the con-
trary, should be left z'n their ignorance, ff they should hold the
trzcth which they had in unrighteousness. Here he openly
suspends the call of the Gospel on the use or abuse of na-
tural gifts. The same Corvinus contends that internal

quickening grace is so set before all men by an ordinary
law, that the difference, why one man is actually made a
partaker of this grace and another is not, is restrained to
the difference of human wills, and not to the good pleasure
of God. Yea, he says, That it is certain that the conversion

strants or Arminians, among whom he laboured as a minister. Disgusted
with the persecutions to which he was exposed, he was obliged in 1622 to
retire into the Duchy of Sleswig, whence he proceeded into France. He

was admitted Doctor of Law at Orleans, and afterwards practised as an ad-
vocate at Amsterdam, where he was appointed professor of Law. Besides

various excellent works on the civil law, some of which are deservedly es·
teemed to this day, he wrote several theological pieces, the most distin-
guished of which is his Defensio Sententioe ιῙιιε. Arminii dc praedestinatione, gra.
ιίἂ Dei, libero hominis arbitrio, &c. adversum Daniclem Tilenum. Lugduni,
1613, 8vo. He is said to have converted his adversary. Corvinus died in
1650. (Biographie Universelle7 tom. X. 1¹· ⁴27²)
