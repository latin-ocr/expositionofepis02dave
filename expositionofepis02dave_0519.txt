one was willing {0 be converted, the other was not willing. 'He
adds further what strikes at the sinews of the Pelagian
and Arminian theology, The concurrence effice-will is cm
effect necessarily consequent, by the necessity of consequence,
from Divino efficocious uid. In these words the learned
Bannes rejects and condemns the opinion of those who
contend that regenerating and saving grace are procured
for and sot before all men on account of the merit of
Christ. And he also refutes those who resolve the reason
why some are regenerated or converted‚ and others are not,
into the willing and refusing of mankind. And he further
teaohes, that our coneurrence οι· non-resistance‚ that is,
our being willing is the necessary effect of effectual grace
given, and therefore is not the reason of its being given or
received.

Alvarez (De auxiliis Divinae grat. disp. 58, p 2622) says.
If we should assert that there was α law made by God, for iiz-
jallibly giving effictuol uid to those that well used, or were
willing co use sufficient aid of their own innate libertis alone,
then the beginning of effectual grace would be from izatzcre,
andfrom the imzate liberty of the mun,who is willing to malfe
α good nse of sufficient aid. This is the very law or decree
of God which is contended for with such earnestness by
Arminius, Corvinus, and other Divines of the same school.
For they say, that sufficient grace is given to all, on ae-
count of the merit of Christ, the Mediator-3 but that ef-
fectual grace, or that which actually converts and regene-
rates, is given on this condition, if they make a good use
of it when it excites them, or is sufficient for them3 that
is, if the will, being excited by grace and made able, puts
forth its innate power of willing3 which is ascribing the
beginning of effectual grace to nature. Alvarez says
again, (ibid.) This conclusion is salse ; Because mon being ex-
cited by God is willing to consent, therefore he is assisted. But
this is true: Because man being excited by sufficient grace is
assistedwe'tlz effectual aid, therefore he co-operates. Which
he fully proves (Disp. 99,) where he also asserts that this
proposition is most true, Because God wills that man should
will, therefore man wills. These things are diametrically
