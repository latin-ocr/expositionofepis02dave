ration work within him both to will and to do. To this Ι add
a passage very similar, from Epist. 105. Pelagius objects‚
What are we to do, who live wickedly, since we have not re-
ceived gracejrom whence we should live well? Augustine re-
plies merely, They cannot trnly say {hey have done no evil,
who of their own accord live wickedly. And a little after,
They may imperte this to themselves, who are of that mass,
which God hath deservedly andjnslly condemned on account of
the sin (ff one. Itis to be observed, that in both these pas-
sages Augustine allows that there are some to whom God
hath denied his grace3 and also, that those to whom it is
not given, cannot take it to themselves3 and further, that
original guilt and depravity is a sufficient reason why God
should deny the grace of Christ to any one, according to
his own will. Moreover, it is also to be observed‚ that
Augustine does not imagine that the saving grace of Christ
is any thing offered to the human will, which knocks in
order that it rnay gain admittance, but something commu-
nicated, which heals and quickens the will to which it is
given. The last testimony which we shall produce from
Augustine is contained in Epist. 107, where he enumerates
against the Pelagians twelve opinions relating to the ca-
tholic saith, the fourth of which is, We know that the grace
of Gode’s not given to alc men. But lest any one should
pretend, that by the death of Christ it was effected, that
grace is prepared for and offered to all, although it may be
possessed or not, according as men are willing or not to
accept it 3 this opinion also is excluded in the fifth and
sixth: of which we shall speak more hereafter. From
Augustine let. us proceed to Prosper. He says (ad excerpta
Genuens. resp. ad dub. 4,) When the word (ff trieth is
preached, some willingly believe it, others do not believe it ,· buc
it is because God opens the hearts of some, and does not open
the lzearts qs others. Which is the same as if he had said,
that the grace of faith is given to some, and denied to
others. And (resp. ad dub. 8,) What else can we say ofthe
Tyricms and Sidoniam, than that it was not given to them to
believe? But why z't was denied to them, let them sais ij they
can, exc. Prosper asserts two things: first, that the gift
