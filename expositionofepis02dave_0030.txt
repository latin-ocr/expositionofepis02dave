glorious3 yet hidden. Therefore, Paul would anticipate
these objections in saying, Your lffe z's hid with Christ in
God. Let us now examine the words themselves respec-
tively.

Your life] The word lg'fe is taken sor that supernatura}
life whereby we live to God under a state of grace, and
whereby we are to live with God in a state of glory : For
the life of grace is nothing else (so to speak) than the
childhood of glory. And both these are called your li e
by way of eminence3 in comparison of which a carnal and
bodily life is considered as death: for a carnal life leads to
death, and that eternal. Whence in the holy Scriptures
they are accounted dead who live after the flesh3 Let the
dead bury their dead: and 1 Tim. v. 6, She that liz-eth in
pleasure is dead while she livelh. Moreover, he who lives
the life of grace according as he is led by the Spirit, he day
by day ripens for eternity, Rom. viii. 13. And as the car-
nal life of sinners is death, if it be compared to the spiri-
tual life of the faithful; so the natural life of man is death,
if it is compared to the supernatural life of the blessed. For
this whole bodily life passes away and vanishes any lno-
ment, nor has it any permanency3 but that whole superna-
tural life stands in the perpetuity of its solidity, and bath
nothing transient. Therefore, the Apostle intending this
spiritual and supernatural life, rightly and emphatically
says, Your life.

Is hid] This may be applied as well to the life of grace
as to the life of glory. The spiritual life of the saints is
hid, First, as to the wicked. For the world does not dis-
cover any thing spiritual in the children of God3 but ac-
counts them the most despicable‚ foolish, and miserable
beings. So says the Apostle, Heb. xi. 36—38, They had
trials of mockings and scourgings, being destitute, afflicted, tor-
mented, of whom the world was not worlhy. Neither is it to
be wondered at, since this spiritual life consists in those
things which meet not the eye or sense3 namely, in adop-
tion, in regeneration‚ in union with Christ, in saith and
love, and the other gifts of the Holy Spirit. Hence that
tardy confession of the ungodly‚ Wisdom v. 3, δὶα. These
