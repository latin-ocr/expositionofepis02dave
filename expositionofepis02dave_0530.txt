Christ loved the church and gave himself for it, that he might
sanctgfy and cleanse it wilh the washing qf water by the word,
that he might present it to himself a gloriolas clmrclz, &c.
(Tit. ii. 14) Jesns Christ gave himselfjor us, that he might
purffy mito himself a peculim· people, διε. (Acts xx. 28)
Feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own
blood. (Ephes. i. 22, 23) He gave lzim to be the head over
all things to the charch, which is his body. (Eph. v· 23)
Christ is the head os the church, and he is the Saviour (ff tlze
body. In all these passages three things are to be ob-
served: first, That by the names of sheep, the charch, the
children of God, the body of Christ, are intended the sheep,
the children of God, and members of Christ, not as ac-
tually united to him by saith already received, but as by
the counsel and design of God to be united by saith to be
received. Secondly‚ That the whole human race promis-
cuously cannot be meant by these titles. Thirdly, When
it is said that Christ died tlzat he might gether together in one
these children qf' God, that he might sanctffzs this charch, that
he might pur-chose this church, διο. there is not denoted in
Christ's offering himself an ineffectual will, or some condi-
tional design, which might fail of the intended effect3 but
an effeetual will and design joined with an infallible event.
It is proved in thefirst place, That his discourse in the pas-
sages aforesaid, is concerning his sheep, his members‚ his
children considered according to the eternal and secret
purpose of Divine election, and not according to their ac-
tual present state; Because no one actually becomes a
sheep of Christ, a child of God, a member of his mysti-
cal body, except by the merit and benefit of the death of
Christ actually and effectually derived and applied to him:
therefore, Christ died for the sheep, for the children of
God, for the church, for the members destined for him
from eternity according to the purpose of electiori, namely,
that by the merit of the death of Christ this predestina-
tion of God might be accomplished in them. Thus Au-
gustine says (in J ohan. tract, 46,) The Lord hnoweth them
that are his,- they are hz's sheep, according to his predestina-
tion‚ according to his forelmowledge, czrcording co his election
