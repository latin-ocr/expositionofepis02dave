shall prove that it is not lawful that this should be done
against the will of the parents. For3

1. To do any thing whatever not commanded by God,
but in manifest violation of a command, is impious and
rash: B‘ut for any one to bind himself to a monastic life
does not come under the Divine precept; and to resist pa-
rents, when they enjoin that upon us which is either good
or is not unlawful, is a manifest violation of a Divine com-
mand: Since, therefore, it is good and lawful to profit
their parents, and to serve them in their domestic cares,
children, whilst not yet free, ought not to desert their pa-
rents against their will.

2. To offer to God what is another's, and that against
his will, is opposed to virtue: But the power over children -
belongs to parents, whilst they are under their keepffig,
so that they cannot of their own will withdraw themselves
from their parents, and betake themselves whither they
wish: therefore they cannot vow to enter a monastery
against the will of their parents. Hither ¹applies that de-
claration in Numb. xxx. 3, 5, If a woman shall leave vowed
in herfatlrer’s house in her ‘youth ; [flam-father shall have dis-
allowed her, her vow shall be void.

Neither is that reply of Bellarmin and Aquinas of any
weight, who say, that before the years of puberty‚ i. e.
(as they interpret it) before the twelfth year, a damsel can-
not vow against the consent of her parents: but afterwards
‹ she may, because she is free in all those things which re-
late to her person: for the context opposes it3 which en-
acts this law concerning every woman remaining in her
father’s house, that is, under the care of her father, whe-
ther she be twelve years old, or more.

3. What it is rash to do without the advice or not with
the approbation of parents, that it is impious to do against
their consent and remonstrances : But it is the part of rash-
neSS, if a youth of sixteen, or a damsel of fifteen, shall
resolve about their mode of life without the knowledge
and approbation of their parents, especially in entering
upon that kind of life, which by a certain necessity calls
them off from yielding submissior] to their parents3 for it
