soever believetli shall be saved. Rom. x. 9. That this cove-
nant concerning the grant of remission of sins, and the
salvation of mankind through fasth, was confirmed by the
blood-shedding and death of the Son of God, appears, in
the first place, from the sacred Scriptures. In the insti- ,
tution of the Lord’s supper, Christ himself says (Luke
xxii. 20), This cup is the new testament in my blood, which, is
slzedjoryon. As if he had said, It is a lively symbol of
the Lord's blood, by which the new covenant concerning
the remissiori of sins and our justification by saith is con-
firmed and established. And the Apostle says (Heb. ix.
22), Wz'tltout sbeddz’ng <ff blood is vo remission. Therefore,
the covenant made with men, by which God bound himself
to remit the sins of those that believe, has its strength or

in whom all the gratuitous promises of God are Y ea and Amen.
(2 Cor. i. 20). Nor, indeed, is the act of faith itself of
such value‚ that it can by its own dignity or merit obtain
from God remissiori of sins and salvation. But of such
great value is the death and blood-shedding of the Son of
God, that by its own merit and virtue it can justify and save
any one that believeth, according to the tenor of the evan-
gelical covenant. Therefore this covenant was confirmed
by the death of Christ.

But, secondly‚ that remains respecting which there are
great scruples, namely, Whether this evangelical covenant,
If thou skalt believe, thou shall be saved, which we have shewn
to be confirmed by the death of Christ, pertains, accord-
