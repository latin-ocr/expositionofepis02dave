202 AN ExPOSITloN oF ST. PAUL’S (Ἴιαμίὶί.

Whatever yse do, do it heartily, εκ ψυχῆς] Two things are
implied in this one word:

l. That servants willingly and cheerfully do what things
are commanded by their masters, not compulsorily and
unwilling-ly. And, indeed, it is very probable, that cer-
tain Christian servants, obeyed their masters rather from
the necessity of their condition, than from the will, espe-
cially unbelieving masters. The Apostle, therefore, endea-
vours to cure this evil, when he bid them to do all things,
not from necessity, but from tlze beart, hear-lily. We do
any thing Ιιεανίίζῃ, when the mind desires and rejoices that
that should be done which the hand does. On the con-
trary, when the mind murmurs and resists‚ although the
outward act may be performed, yet it is done rather from
the body than from the mind. For, as Prosper rightly
said, If any thing be done against the will, it is done rather
for thee than that thou doest it.

2. By this word it is also signified, that servants ought
to obey their masters μετ’ ἐυνοιάς, that is to say, not only
should they be well disposed to the execution of the work,
but even possess benevolence of spirit towards the com-
mandet of the work. And these for the most part are eon-
nected together3 for no one performs the work imposed
upon him cheerfully, except he who strives and reverences
him who commanded the work. And this is expressly laid
down in Ephes. vi. 7, μετ’ ἐννοίας δουλεύοντες, η’ἱιΙι good will
doing service. No one obeys better tlzan he wlzo readers obc-
diem-esrom love, says Ambrose. Thus much for the condi-
tion: Let us now come to the reason of this condition.

2. As to the [ον-ἅ, and not zcnto mem] That is, as those
who serve the Lord rather and more especially than men,
even in such compliances as are rendered to men: for
the use or utility of the works has respect to men3 the
mind of the doer first and especially ιο God. Therefore,
the negative particle in this place is not used absolutely,
as though it were wicked to serve men, or to respect men
whilst serving them3 but it is corrective and diminu-
tive, shewing that it behoves us to regard the Lord
Christ more and first in those eompliances, than earthly
