Chap. vii. As ιτ REGARDS THE PREDES‘l'uNATED. 541

sim, writes thus, Hence Zacharias sayS‚ HE HATH RE-
DEEMED nis PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE os His SERVANT
DAvun. Therefore those whom he forelcnew to be his own,
without doubt he came to sava· all the rest he hath left by his
secretjudgment in the mass of αἰινηηαίὶοης In these words
he teaches that Christ came into the world and suffered
death, with some special intention of saving the predesti-
nate; buthe had not the same special intention to effect
the salvation of others, although he was willing to make
salvation procurable by all on condition of saith.

Tsssr. 9. Gregory the Great says (Moral, lib. 22, cap.
18, p. 132) For the only begotten Son of God to intercedejor
man, is, with the co-eternal Father, the same as to demonstrate
that he was man: amdfor him to have petitionedvz'n belmlf of
haman nature, is to have taken the same nature into the height ’
of his divinity. He intercedes, therefore,jor us, not with
words, but with comptissime ; because what he was unwilling
should be condemned in the elect. he delivered them from by
undertaking z't. The last words are especially to be noticed‚
in which it is clearly indicated, that Christ in his whole
mediatorial office had a special regard to the infallible de-
liverance of the elect.

TEsT. lo. Bernard on Psalm xci„ He who dwelleth in the
secret place of the JlJoSt High, vers. 9th‚ says, Christ died
sor hia-friends, that ix, to acquire chem,- ευ that out (fene-

of the bread and wine in the Lord's Supper, nothing remained of these
symbols but the outward figure, under which the identical body and blood
of Christ were really present. Thus was revived and brought into shape
in the Latin Church that doctrine which has occasioned so much contention
in the Church and havoe among Christians—the doctrine of Transubstan-
tiation, which had been first started by a Monk at the beginning of the 7th
Century. This doctrine being thus introduced into the X‘Vestern Church
occasioned a violent controversy. It was vigorously opposed by Rabanus
Maurus, Archbishop of Mentz, the most considerable man of his times,
who says, it was an error newly broached. Most of the learned men of
that age took part in the controversy it excited. Paschasius was con-
strained to resign his Abbey in consequence of the opposition his opinion
met, and he died soon after, in 865. His other works are Commentaries on
St. Matthew3 on Psalm xliv.; and on the Lamentations of Jeremiah:
with Treatises De Partu Virgini53 De Corpore Christi, &c. His works
were collected and published by Father Sirmond, in 1618.
