who, from this sitting of Christ at the right hand of God,
endeavour to infer, that Divine Majesty, ubiquity, and all
the properties of Deity are really communicated to the
human nature of Christ. But they are easily refuted3

l. Because, if the Divine attributes be really commu-

nicated to the human nature, the human nature is really
God: for the Divine attributes are nothing else than the

Divine essence. We therefore acknowledge that Christ
incarnate has an equality of glory and majesty with God
the Father: but we deny that the flesh of Christ, or the
human nature, has, or can have this3 because it is not con—
substantial with God, although it is hypostatically united
to God.

2. They are refuted from the circumstance of time. For
(as they will have it) a real communication of attributes
to the human nature arises from its hypostatic union with
the Divine: but this sitting of the man Christ at the right
hand of God, of which the Apostle speaks, followed his
passion and resurrection. This we learn from the order of
the articles in the Apostle's Creed: He rose agaz‘n5 he as-
cended into lzmvem he sat down, διο. This Christ himself
teaches us, Luke xxiv. 26, Ought not Christ to leave suffered,
and to enter into his glory? And the Apostle, Heb. i. 3,
Ajter that lte lzacl purged our sins, lte sat down at tlte right
hand qs the Majesty on high.

3. As to the ubiquity of Christ’s body3 that is mani-
festly refuted, not established in this place. For the Apos-
tle says, that the minds of Christians ought to be directed
heavenward, not set upon earthly thing-S, for this reason, that
Christ is exalted at the right hand of God in the heavens,
now no more to dwell with us upon earth in his bodily pre-
sence, although as to the presence of the Divine Majesty
he is ever with us. Thus in Ephes. i. 20, He set Christ at
llis own right hand. W'here '3 In tlte lzeavens ; and Heb. i. 3,
in the highest places. Although, therefore, the right hand
of God is every where, if thereby we understand the
Divine Majesty and power3 because God is every where:
yet Christ, as far as regards his body, or his human nature,
is set at the right hand of God, not as regards his ubiquity,
but his presence in heaven.
