at the appointed moment of time, but the eternal virtue of
the death of Christ, bringing salvation to mankind in every
age. For Christ, as to the intention of God, was a Lamb
slain from tlze foundation of the world, and the efficacy of
this propitiatory sacrifice could extend itself as much to
those who lived before Christ suffered, as to us who live
after his passion. If therefore they only mean, that those
could not be relieved by the death of Christ in time, who
before his death were by an irrevocable decree adjudged to
infernal punishment, we confess the same3 because they
had then ceased to be living in this world, and therefore
were not capable of repentance and faith; but if they
mean to contend further, that the eternal virtue of the
death of Christ was not applicable to such persons while
they were alive in this world, because the passion of Christ

though he determined and declared that the death of his
Son was applicable to any one under the condition of saith,
yet he did not determine to cause it by the benefit of his
special mercy to be applied equally to every one. We do
not deny therefore what is evident, namely, that the dif-
fereuce between devils and men consists in this, that from
the ordination of God, the death of Christ is a thing or-
dained for and applicable to mankind 3 but neither ordained
for, nor applicable to devils; although after this life, to
men placed in hell there is no further possibility of appli-
