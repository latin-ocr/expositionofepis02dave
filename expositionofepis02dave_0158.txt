yield to those circumstances, which accord with the Chris-
tian doctrine and profession: we ought not therefore to
eat, nor drink, nor clothc our bodies, not to use relaxation

to Christ. But we must also add, That it is the best
thing, as often as it can be done, to raise our thoughts ac-
tually to Christ in all our doings: moreover it is fit and ne-
cessary, that we do that as often as the nature of the ac-
tion which we undertake and transact requires it, as when
the matter is of a sacred character, or of great importance
to our salvation-
