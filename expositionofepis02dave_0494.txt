all sufficient means of application, he would not suffer any
one through carelessness to defraud another of a benefit
due to him, especially of such an one as that, without which
no salvationis to be hoped for. Moreover‚ it implies a
contradiction, that God, by his ordinary law should pro-
vide and administer to all men the means relative to the
application of Christ, and not administer them to some,
because of the carelessness of the preachers. As if the
care of the preachers were not to be numbered among
these means without which the knowledge and application
of Christ preached cannot be obtained, Further, If the

despised it. We are not therefore to refer it to the absolute will
of God, that the saving light ofthe Gospel does not shine upon
some nations. (Corvin. p. 108, and Voss. p. 671).

Rssnv. But neither do these things well consist with
their opinions. For if God, respect being had to the
death of Christ, had determined to administer to all men
