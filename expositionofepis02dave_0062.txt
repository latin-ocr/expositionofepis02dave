idol‚· the latter, the gold ; tlzis immolares oxen am] sheep to his-
idols; that gives up lzis mind and affictz‘ons to covetousness.
Such and many more like remarks hath Chrysostom. But
it may still more perspicuously be said, That a covetous
man is an idolater, because he loves his riches above all
things3 because he trusts in them more than all things3
because he serves his riches more than he does God him-
self.

1. Because he loves them above all things: for as Cle-
mens has rightly observed, Paedag. Q. 12, Heaven is open,
and he seelcs not Gocl; gold is lzidden, and lze ransaclcs the
bowels of the eartlrfor z't. Whence does this arise, unless
because he had rather enjoy riches than God? Therefore,
he commits spiritual idolatry with the riches of the world,
not, as Gregory somewhere observes, by the exhibition of
ceremonies‚ but by the oblation qfconcupiscence. For to what-
ever the affections of the heart cling as the chief good,
that is taken into the place of God.

2. Because also he places that trust in riches which is
due to God alone. For, in his beart he says to gold (what
Job, xxxi. 24, loathes) thou art my lzopae and to the fine
gold thou art my corfidcnce. Now that in which we hope,
we make our God. Therefore, the voice of all the godly
is, In the Lord have I lzoped,· Ι have made God my helper.
But the covetous man has money alone as the sponsor or
surety ἐ’γΓυητην of his felicity.

3. Because he altogether neglects the service due to
God, and gives his whole service to the scraping together
of money. Ye cannot serve God and ZWammon, Matt. vi.
24. And, therefore, as the god of the gluttonous is their
belly‚ because their belly is perpetually served3 so the
god of avaricious men is money, because they serve money
day and night.

Corollaries.

l. Nothing is more miserable or more foolish than a
covetous man3 because he forsakes God, and confides in
clay. But tlzeir silver and their gold shall not be able to deli-
ver tlzem in the day (gf tlze Lord's wradz, Zeph. i. 18. There-
