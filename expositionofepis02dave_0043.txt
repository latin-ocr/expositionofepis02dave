Ver. 5. EP18TLE To Tun COLOSslANs. 33

and this is the work of the Divine spirit alone, infusing it
where he will: but this mortification he effects whilst he
infuses himself into the human soul together with the gifts
of his grace, by the efficacy of which the power and do-
minion of sin is mortified and overthrown. Secondly, that
which we call external or praeciae& and this is the work of
the renewed man himself, whilst by the aid of the spirit,
he brings forth the fruits of that internal mortification‚ that
is, whilst he resists the temptations of sin, whilst he re-
strains inordinate affections, whilst 116 diligently takes care
lest 116 fall into unlawful deeds3 for he who does this is
said to mortify his flesh. Therefore, the act of mortifica-
tion attributed to us is nothing else than the ἐνέργειιι, 01
operation springing from infused grace, even that which
we have called the inter-nal or lzabitual mortification effected
by the Holy Spin-it.

2. It is again asked, How this Apostolic exhortation
agrees with the preceding (ἒ Η6 had said, ver. 3, that the‘y
were dead, now he adds, IVIortify your members: but what
necessity is there that any one dead should be still ordered
to mortify himself?

The solution depends upon what was before said. First,
then, we answer, that the Colossians were dead sacramen-
tally by having received baptism3 but are bidden 10 mor-

now these things are accordant, not contradictory. Se-
condly, we say that they were moreover dead by habitual
mortification, viz. through the effect of internal mortifica-
tion infused into their hearts by the Holy Spirit: and they
ought to mortify themselves by a practical mortification,
exercising infused grace in opposing their lusts. Thirdly,
we also add, that the cause of natural death and spiri-
tual mortification are different. He who has undergone
natural death 15 vainly commanded any more to mortify
himself daily3 because natural death is pure privation, and
admits not in the subject of it any thing contrary: but
spiritual mortification is not pure privation 3 sor whilst we
carry this mortal body, every thing inducing to the con-
trary is to be relinquished, because it must be perpetually
