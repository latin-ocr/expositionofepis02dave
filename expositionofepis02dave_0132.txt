commanded, and concerning the degree. True charity ful-
fils the law in all its parts, but not in full degree. But
justification is not had from the law unless it be fulfilled in
both ways3 each being included in the Divine command.
We add this also, That charity if it be itself perfect, brings
the perfect fulfilment of the law3 for if the principle that
operates be imperfect in any respect, the operations flow-
ing from it must also be imperfect. Now we have the tes-
timony of Augustine to shew that charity is imperfect in
every mortal, Eqist. 29. ad Hiero. Emire charitis exists in
πο individual as long as lze lives here on earth .· but tlzat which
is less ίΙιαιι ic ought to he, par-takes of sin .· from this sin tlzere
is ηο manfree upon earth. This also Aquinas acknowledges,
Quaest. disp. de charit. art. 10.

But there are others who refer this pei-fection to the
body of the church, and affirm that charity is the bond of
perfectness in the chureh, since it unites her members one
with another, and effects a community of mutual opera-
tions for the advantage and preservation of the whole. For
as the perfectior] of the natural body arises from the union
and connexion of the parts, so much so, that we accountit

halt and imperfectis they be torn away or separated: so
the body of the church is considered perfect and entire, as
all its members are held together by the bond of charity3
but weak and imperfect if they should be drawn asunder
by quarrelling and malice. In this sense, therefore, cha-
rity may be called the hond ofperfectness. For the Apostle
teaches, Rom. xii. 5, that the church is one hody; and
again. in Ephes. iv. 16, that this body increases, as far as it is
fill-'yjoined together ancl compacted by that which every joint
supplz'eth, according to the eff'ectual working cf every part.
Nothing, therefore, prevents our admitting charity, in both
respects‚ to be the hond quergfectness. These things being
explained, we must point out some general corollaries or
instructions which flow from the above.

l. We hence learn to examine our acts of beneficence
and mercy, in order to ascertain whether they flow from
charity or not. Many persons impose upon themselves,
zmd while they aire dreaming that they perform acts of cha-
