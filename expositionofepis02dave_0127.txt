Gorgia) draws the conclusion, that every injury is disho-
nourable and infamous to the inflictor of it, not to him wlzo
szffers it ; and that, as he says himself, for the strongest and
most solid reasons, σιδηροῖς καὶ ἀδαμαντίνοις λόγοις. Aristotle fol-
lows th‘e same opinion in his Ethics 5. cap. ll, giving this
reason3 To inflict an itgjury is tlte effect (ff dz'sleonesty; and
on that account dishonourable and infamans: but to stffer
-οηε ’ωἰιΙι equanimity is tlze ‘ffffst (ff virtue, and therefore glo-
rious. Seneca, in that book where he professedly consi-
ders whether an injury can affect a wise man, writes3 We
ougl'zt to despise injurie& (md what I may call the slzadow of
itgjure‘es, contumelzs, whether they fall deservedty or undeser-
vedtq upon us. [f deservedly, it is not contumel-q, butjudgment
given ; if undeservedly, it is for lzz'm who did the irgjury, and
not for me to be ashamed of it. That we may not accumu- ¹
late more from profane authors, we have the opinion of
Christ himself, Matt. v. ll, Blessed are με when men shall
revile you.

2. Should we grant that injury or contumely has been
cast upon us, and that to do this is criminal; nevertheless
it by no means follows, that it is lawful to repel it by
means of a duel: and that for these reasons 3

1. No one ought to bejudge in his own cause3 and,
least of all, one who is disturbed with anger, violence, and
the passion of revenge. Tertullian, De patient. says, What
hace I to do with a passion, wlziclz Ι cannot govern through ‘im-
patience?

2. Individuals do injury to God and his vicarious repre-
sentative, the magistrate, when they seek to revenge them-
selves by private means. Vengeance is mine, and I will re-
pay, saith the Lord, Deut. xxxii. 353 and Rom. xiii. 14,
Paul says of the magistrate, He beoreth not the sword in
vain. But he would bear it in vain, if it was allowed to an
individual to draw the sword at his own pleasure.

3. Duellists would punish every injury with the same
punishment, namely, death 3 which is not the judgment of
a generous man, but of a madman. Now every punish-
ment inflicted by one possessed of all his faculties, ought
to be commensurate with the offenee.
