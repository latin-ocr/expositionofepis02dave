47⁸2 Α DlSSliR'l'ATlON ΟΝ THE DEATH OF cnms'r.

for to be recma-[led to God is to be delivered from the guilt of
death, to be placed in a state of spiritual life, and to be
presented with an hereditary right to eternal life3 which
things do not belong to the elect merely because they are
elected, but when they have been effectually called and
converted to God. The Apostle himself has taught this in
verse 8, By grace are με saved through saith ,· aud that not (ff
yourselves; it is the gift ofGod. The last passage taken
from Coloss. i. 21, 22, plainly confirms our opinion,
namely, that mankind are not at once justified and recon-
ciled to God, either by God’s eternal act of predestination,
or by the merit of the death of Christ for his own elect.
For what else do these words mean at first sight, Yon, that
weresorrrzerly alienated, 810. yet now hatlz lie reconciled, than
that we then at length obtain, through the blood of Christ,
remissiori of sins and actual reconciliation with God, when,
being united to Christ by saith, we are admitted into an
actual participation and possession of his merits and righ-
teousness. It is unnecessary to add more for the explana-
tion of this proposition. From what has been said, it may
sufficiently appear, that those persons extend the universal
efficacy of the death of Christ beyond its just limits‚ who
think that by the mere act of the death of Christ all man-
kind promiscuously are restored to a state of grace3 nor
do they do less, who cont-end that all the predestinated,on
account of the merit of Christ, are justified from eternity,
and actually reconciled to God, even before they have be-
lieved the Gospel.
