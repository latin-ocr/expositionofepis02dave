upon the cross, that he is ready to embrace any sinner
whenever he shall repent and believe. Therefore, the un-
reasonable speculation of election and reprobation being
set aside, the aforesaid efficacy of the death of Christ as
to all men individually ought to be acknowledged, and to
be preached to all prorniscuously.

Secondly. The actual reconciliation of every individual
person, which is promised and exhibited to every one that
believeth‚ on account of the merit of Christ crucified, pre-
supposes the first degree of reconciliation3 by which God
is understood to be so pacified by the death of Christ, that
he is now willing, on the performance of the condition of
saith, to restore any sinner‘ to his favour. Those therefore
who confess that any person, however loaded with sins, as
soon as he believes is received into favour on‘account of ·
the death and merit of Christ, ought not to deny that this
is effected by the death of Christ as to all men individu-
ally, that they may account God to be ready, yea, obliged
to grant this benefit to any one on the aforesaid condition.
The antecedent is confirmed, because we cannot conceive
that the act of reconciliation proceeds, or is terrninated as
it were, by a perpetual law, in any person who believes at
the very moment in which he apprehends the Mediator by
a true saith, unless at the same time we suppose and
acknowledge the Divine will to be so prepared and predis-
posed, by the death of Christ, that he is inclined to grant
this favour to any person, provided he should believe. I
perceive that this propensity or readiness of the Divine
will to grant pardon and grace to any man, as soon as he
should perform the condition of saith, is expressed by some
persons by the word placability or reconcilz'abz'lity. Why
some Divines so superciliously reject this placability or
reconciliability‚ obtained hythe passion of Christ, consi·
dered in itself alone, I do not understand. For God would
not be actually pacified and reconciled to any man, as soon
as he should believe, that is, on the performance of the
condition of faith, unless he were placable and reconcile-
able to any man before he should believe, that. is, when the
condition of saith should be performed.
