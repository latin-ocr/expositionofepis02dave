Ver. 24. EPJSTLE το THE COL0551ANS. 207

vii. 20, Let every man abide in the same calling wlierein he wa5
called; For· he that is called in the Lvml, being a servant, is tlte
Lord’sfree man ; vers. 22.

2. Itis not proper to fix the eyes or the mind upon
those light rewards which are promised by men to those
doing well3 but it behoves us always to regard that eter-
nal reward which God the Father has promised to his obe-
dient children. Thus Paul in discharging his vocation,
regards not the reward of human favour or glory, or of
earthly gain, but that Crown wlziclz the Lord shall give to all
tlzose loving his appearing, 2 Tim. iv. 8.

3. They sin who leave off to do well, or at least act
languidly and remissly‚ on account of the ingratitude and

know that he shall receive the reward of the inheritance¹
from Christ3 with which he ought to be content, although
in the mean while he is neglected and evil intreated by
men.

4. They also err who attribute this reward of blessed-
ness to their merits. For although it is given to the la-

adoption excludes merit, if it be rightly defined by Law-
yers. Adoption, says Durandus, lib. 3. dist. lO, qu. 2, is
the gratuitous taking <ff α persora to a participation of an in-
herz'tance, to which iuherilance he had no right. And thus
much concerning the promise of the reward: The confir-
mation of the promise follows.

For ye serve tlte Lorcl Chriszst] This concerning their re-
ward being received from Christ himself avails to confirm
the hope of servants. For the work and the reward are
related3 Therefore, equity demands that for whom the
work is done, from him thereward should be expected. It
will seem scarcely credible, that they who discharged the
meanest offices among men here on earth, should be said
on this very account to serve Christ himself, who sits in
the heavens most glorious and by no means needing human
service. But the reason is manifest (as we have largely
explained in the foregoing verse,) namely, that whatever
