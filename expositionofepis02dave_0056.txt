46 AN ExposlTloN or ST. PAUL’s Chap. iii.

Lastly we must also add3 that this remedy (the tolera-
tion of brotliels*) is worse than even the disease which is
dreaded. For although adultery be in itself worse than
fornication3 yet it is worse for a whole city to be conti-
nually polluted by brothels‚ than if it should sometimes
happen that certain wedded women be violated. But even
this is by no means to be conceded3 that the honour and
chastity of married women can be better preserved by the
permission of fornication than by the severe punishment
of it. For by impunity, and the continued habit of sin-
ning we become more daring; ancl if we have served an
apprenticeship to lust among harlots, becoming anon ve-
terans, we the more confidently assault wedded females.
This point acquires support from the fact, that we scarcely
ever have either read or heard of married women having
been defiled by any other than by those who were before
accustomed to practices with harlots: so admirably does
the toleration of brothels conduce to the protection of the
chastity of married women !—And these remarks may suf-
fice against those who either deny that fornication is to be
accounted a sin, or say that it is to be tolerated for the
sake of avoiding adultery. We have dwelt the longer in
opposing fornicati0n‚ because it has obtained its patrous.
The other vices which remain we shall remark upon more
briefly.

In the second place, then, anaSapcna, or undecennes& fol-
lows: By which term the Apostle would comprehend all
the more filthy kinds of lust, as adultery, incest, rape, and
especially those sins of excess which even nature herself
abhors. Therefore‚ they who not only wallow in one kind
of lust, but in different kinds, and those the most foul, are
called the unclean. This zmcleamzess prevailed among almost
all the Gentiles3 which you may easily gather from their
poets, who often blame, although they sometimes approve
these impurities, Rom. i. 27. Tertullian, in his book, De

³· The horrid fact may not be generally known among Protestants that
Public stews‚ or houses of prostitutimr, are to this day officially licensed
in Papal States, and that his Holiness derives a large portion of his revenue
