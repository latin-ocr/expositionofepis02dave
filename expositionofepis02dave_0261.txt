3. The certain primary business of this requisite wis-
dom 3 redeeming the time.

Wallc in wisdom.] To walk in wisdom is to do all things
cautiously and circumspectly‚ as men are wont to do when
they perceive that they are beset on every side with diffi-
culties and dangers: for danger is the whetstone of wis-
dom. Believers in those days lived in the midst of hea-
thens ruling over Christians themselves, and serving idols
and daemons: there was need therefore of remarkable and
precise wisdom, so to keep the middle course between
Scylla and Charybdis, as neither to confirm the pagans

God himself whom they worshipped, and imputed the
wickedness of private men to our religion. This was

phemed among the Gentiles through you. In fine, this Apos-
tle employs this as a special incentive to integrity of life,
1 Tim. vi. 1, Thac the name (ff God and his doctrine be not
blasphemed. Cyprian graphically describes the insult and
blasphemy of unbelievers bnrsting forth on this account;
whose words I transcribe out of his hook De dupl. martyr.
Beholael they who boast that they are redeemedfrom the tyranny
of Satan, who preach that they are dead to tlze world, never-
theless are ovet-come by [heir lusts as well as ure, whom they
affirm lo be yet held under the dominion (ff Satan. What does
baptism prcfit them? What cloes the Holy spirit profit them,
