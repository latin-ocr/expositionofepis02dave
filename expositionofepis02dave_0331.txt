the salvation ancl redemption of all men. It is manifest from
the Answers of Prosper to the Capitula of the Gallican
Divines?ss where their ninth objection is given after this
manner: That tlze Savioicr was noc crncfiecl for tlze redemp-
tion (ftlze whole world. The Seinipelagians objected to
this as' new, invidious, and erroneous. But Prosper meets
these objections, not by maintaining that Christ suffered
only for the elect, but by shewing whence it arises that
the passion of Christ is profitable and saving to the elect
alone3 namely‚ because these only through the benefit of
special grace obtain persevering saith, whereby they are
enabled to apply to themselves the death of Christ. All
others without the assistance of this special grace, through
their own fault, either remain altogether in uubelief, or
draw back from saith received, and therefore fail of the
benefits of redemption. This is the tendency of the'

of novelty and heresy, which the enemy of souls is causing to spring and
grow again in this age. It is incumbent upon every one to revise the his-

themselves of fathers and divines which are now often appealed to, that by

'⁵ CAPITULA GALLORUM‚ or objections of the Gallican Divines. These
were chiefly the priests of Marseilles, about whose series of objections
(which probably were those attributed toVincentius) Prosper wrote toAugus-

, 11115, propounding those objections, and praying him to answer them. This
letter is among Augustine's Epistles, and his reply to it in his Books of the
Saints' Predestination and of the Gift of Perseverance, proved so satisfac-
tory to Prosper's mind, that he became the zealous defendet of Augustine
against those who attacked his opinions.

† The objections started by others must certainly be here intended3 per-
haps those Monks who stole a portion of the Manuscript of Vincentius's
