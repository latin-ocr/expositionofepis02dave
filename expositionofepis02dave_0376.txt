366 A DISSERTATION ON THE DEATH OF eflssisr.

CHAPTER III.

ANSWERS TO OBJECTIONS.

Emona we explain those things which may be objected
on the other side, it should be premised‚ that we do not
undertake the cause of those who declare that Christ by
his death obtained remissiori of sins, reconciliation with
God, and a state of salvation for each and every man.
