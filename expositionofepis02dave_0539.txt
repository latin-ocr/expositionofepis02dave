tuin such ate effect. Therefore, to merit effictually, 01· as to
its efficacis, is to apply his merit to some persons with that
intention, that they should infallibly obtain from it the ef-
fect of eternal life. He says a little more plainly, (p. 635)

ciency, not as to its efficiency ,· which is to be understood not
only on account of the eff'ect, which is produced in one ancl not
in another, but also on account of the will, by wlziclz Christ

in Spain, in 1548. After having completed his education as a law student
at Salamanca, he entered into the Society ofthe Jesuits, who employed him
to teach philosophy at Segovia, and he subsequently occupied the Chairs of
theology at Valladolid, Rome, Alcala, and Salamanca. 'l'he first Profes-
sorship in the University of Coimbra becoming vacant, it was bestowed on
Suares by Philip ΙΙ. at the request of the heads of that Institution. He
took an active part in the disputes which originated from the 'l'heological
doctrine of Father Molina, on the subjectos Grace, which Suares endea-
voured to explain by means of the principle termed “ Congruism.” He
published a work against our King, James I., in defence of the Roman
saith, for which he received the public thanks of the Pope and the King of
Spain ς but the book was prohibited in England and France, and ordered to
be burnt in London by the common hangman. His death took place in Sept.
1617, at Lisbon, whither he had gone to be present at Conferences to be
held before the Legate of the Holy See. His works, extending to twenty-
three Volumes folio, were published at Mentz and Lyons, 1630, &c. and
reprinted at Venice in 1740. His “ Tractatus de Legibu8‚ ac Deo Legis-
latore,'' esteemed his best work, was printed in London, 1679, folio. An
abridgment of the works of Suares, by Father Noel, appeared at Geneva,
1732, two Vols. folio.-Moreri.-Biog. Univ.
