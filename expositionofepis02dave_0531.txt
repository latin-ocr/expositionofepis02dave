of the sheep, before the formation os the world. And (Traet
49, page 366) he thus speaks of the children of God that
were scattered abroad· These things are said according to
predestination .· For they were not as yet the sheep οι· the chil-
dren of God, because they hod not yet believed. lt is proved,
δεεοηᾱζῃ, That in the passages alleged, the death of Christ
is said to be limited to certain persons for some special
reason„ For otherwise why would the Scripture have men-
tioned sheep, children, or the chutch, if it wished to mark
that it is extended to all? It would have been in vain to
make use of words which describe a small part of the hu-
man rece, unless it had also shewn that the design of
Christ in this thing did not regard the whole human race,
but referred to those few only. The death of'Christ, and ⁴
the design of God embracing all mankind promiscuously
is excellently expressed, John iii. 16, God so loved the world,
that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever behet-eth* ia
him should not perish, but have everlasting li e. But he so
loved his sheep, his children, his church, that he deter-
mined by his death effectually to derive to them faith and
eternal life. As often as the holy Scripture makes mention
of the death of Christ in reference alone to the churcb,

the sheep, the members of his mystical body, it would
unfold to ns the special design of Christ in offering him-
self, arising from his special love3 according as Aquinas
says (Part. 3, qu. 24, art. 4‚) Godjore-ordained the salvation
of the elect, by predestinating from elerm'ty, that ic should be
occomplished through Jesus Christ. It is proved, Thirdly,
That in the passages aforesaid, it is shewn that the will of
God the Father and of Christ, concerning the salvation of
the sheep by the death of Christ, is not ineffectual or con-
ditional, but absolute and effectual ς Because Christ speak-
ing of the same sheep, says, (John Χ. 28) Igz've unto them
eternal lise, and they shall never pen-ish.- and (John xvii. 24)
Father‚ I will thal they also, whom thou hast given me, be
with me where Ι am. And (Eph. v. 23) the Apostle says of
that church for which Christ gave himself, Christ is the
head of the clzurch, and he is the Saviour of the body. These
passages all express an absolute will joined with its effect]
