Ver-‚21 EPlSTLE το THE cotossmNs. 193

let us examine in one or two words, what relates to the
consideration of the persons.

Two persons are here marked out: he, or they to whom
this interdict is given of not using provocation ; those are
fathers: and they concerning whom, or on whose behalf it
is given; and these are the children of those fathers.

First, we must observe in this personal designation why
the Apostle should not have retained a word which he used
in the foregoing verse, when he gave the precept concern-
ing the obedience of children: for there he speaks of pa-
rents, that is, of father and mother conJ'ointly3 here he
speaks offather alone. He seems to do this, because chil-
dren often offend in defect of obedience towards their mo-
thers; therefore when he prescribes concerning obedience‚
it was very necessary to include mothers : bnt mothers sel-¹
dom offend towards their children by too much severity;
therefore it was sufficient to have fathers alone restrained
by this interdict. For too much indulgence is the sin of
mothers, not cruelty, which scarcely happens in a. father,
unless he is void of all paternal affection.

Secondly, it is proper to observe that argument which is
implied in the termfatlier. For when he sayS, Fathers,
provolcenot‚ it is as if he had said, Do not what ought to
be most foreign from the person and office of a father. The
very namesatlzer‚ bespeaks clemency and mildness. Hence
that saying of the poet,

He was gentle, as α Fatlter.

And here earthly fathers have before them for their imita-
tion an example of their heavenly Father, who is never so
wrath against his children, but he is mindful of his pater-
nal cleinency, as it is in Psalm lxxxix. 31, &c- If tlzey
break my statutes aud lceep not my commandments, leen will I
visit their transgression with tlze rod, and their iniquicy with
stripes ; Nevertlzeless my lovi'ng lcindness will I not utterly [alce
from him, nor szgffer misjhiclgfulness tessal, &c.

Thirdly‚ we must also notice that argument which is im-
plied under these words, your children. For what else is
this, than as if he had said, Afflict not your flesh, your
blood, your bowels, your own selves, by any injury. For
