given to him by the Father. And in this sense we contend
that Christ laid down his life for the elect alone, or in
order to purchase his Church3 that is, that he died for
thern alone, with the special and certain purpose of effec-
tually regenerating and saving thern by the merit of his
death. Thzwefore, although the merit of Christ equally
regards all men as to its sufficiency‚ yet it does not as to
its efficacy: which is to be understood, not only on ac·
count of the effect produced in one and not in another,
but also on account of the will, with which Christ himself
merited, and offered his merits, in a different way for dif-
ferent persons. Now, the first cause and source of this
diversity‚ was the election and will of God, to which the
human will of Christ conformed itself. And from hence ·
Suares rightly deduces, That this merit of Christ is the very
cause of spiritual regeneration, ancl gives z't efficacy, and pro-
duces its effect, and at the same time z's the cause why that niam
is reginei-atat, on account of whom he specz’allq offered his
merit (in 3, qu. 19, disp. 41, ᾗ 2, p. 635.) For our Di-
vines, let that eminently learned man of picus memory,
Robert, Bishop of Salisbury, speak. Thus he says, (in
'l'homson Diatr. p. 94) Altlzouglz we do not deny that Christ
diedfor all men, yet we believe that he died specially and pe-
culturlyfor the Charch, nor does the beuefit of redemption per-
taiu in an equal degree to all. And from the peculiarity of
this benejit, and from the human will, in some degree depetads
the efficacy of all means, chat they are for those only, and
for their use, whom L hrist redeemed with some peculim· regard
to then· being elected in him. Nor clo they obtain the effect,
because (ff being willing, but because God, accordmg to the
purpose of his own grace, worlcs in the elect and recleemed to
will that to which he chooses them. Therefore, He, who by
his death merited eternal life-sufficiently for all rhen, so as
that it is to be given to all, according to the evangelical
covenant, if they believe, also merited most effectually for
some, by the peculiar application of his merits, that they
should believe, and that they should receive eternal life
from the gratuitous gift of God, through and on account
