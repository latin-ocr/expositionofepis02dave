102 AN exposvrrou OF s'r. PAUL’S Chap. iii.

cap. 53 and Prosper is of the same opinion, De. vita con-
templ. lib. 3. cap. 1 and 16, Virtues are neither sozcglzt after
nor possessed without the gift <ff God.

Virtues and garments differ: 1. Because the latter are
daily put on and off3 but it is sinful to throw aside virtues
once put on. 2. Because garments do not become better,
but worse from daily wear3 but virtues continually aug-⁴
ment and strengthen by exercise. 3. Because we can pro—
cure clothes by our own efforts3 but virtues cannot be
obtained but by the gift of another, nanoely, God.

Here it may be asked, Why he bids the Colossians to
put on virtues, when it is said that true virtue is infused
into the human mind by God3 and why, too, does he bid
them to put on what 118 had before said that they had put
on?

I answer, it is clear from what preceded, that he ad-
dresses those whom he presupposes to be regmerate, holy,
and endowed with infused virtues3 and, therefore, to put
on howels osmercieS, kindness, διο. denotes nothing more
than daily to advance and exercise in their lives the virtues
iinpressed upon their hearts by the Holy Spirit. But now,
although it is the work of God alone to infuse into the heart
spiritual gifts and virtues proceeding from grace, yet, hu-
man co-operation is required in the exercise of them: See
for instance Paul, in l Cor. xv. 10, By che grace (ff God I
am what I am, (md his grace which was bestowed upon me was
11οί in vain, but I laboured more (ebtmdanlly than they all; yet
not I, but tlte grace (ff God which was witlz me.

As to the other part of the objection, it may also be
added3 the elect and holy who have put on virtues and
gifts by the life-giving aid of the Holy spirit, both can
and ought to put on the same more and more3 which, in-
deed, they 318 said to do, when they endeavour that these
gifts of the Spirit may be confirmed and augmented by
use and exercise. For although the power of increasing
does not agree very well with the clothing of the body,
yet it does with these garments of the mind. As Peter
says, in 2 Epis. iii. 18, Grow in grace and itt tlte knowledge
os tlte Lorcl. These things may suffice concerning the act
