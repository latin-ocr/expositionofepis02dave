2. Children are provoked, if parents endeavour to load

them with impious and unjust commands. That was im-
pious of Saul when he commanded Jonathan to seize and
bring David his friend, guiltless of any crime, that he
might be put to death, 1 Sam. xx. 31. Hence we read,
vers. 34, that Jonathan was inflamed with grief and anger.
' That was likewise impious of Hei-odias, who ordered her
daughter (to whom Herod had promised to give whatever
she might ask) to ask the head of John the Baptist, Matt.
xiv. 8. But we do not read that this dancing daughter was
offended at the impious command of her mother, because-
she equalled her mother in impiety: if she had had any
piety, she would have grieved at it. But again, Icall that
an unjust command, if a father, impelled by no necessity,
should endeavour by his authority to compe} his son to
servile deeds, and unworthy of a free man. For the con-
dition of children is one thing, that of slaves another.
Among children, a father holds not a tyrannical‚ but a
kingly rule; Therefore 116 ought to use their labour as a
good king uses the labour of citizens, not as a master
abuses the labour of servants. This Aristotle himself has
noted, Polit. i. 7 ε and viii. 2.

3. It pertains to this provocation, when parents being
seized with anger, rashly revile and wound their children
when they do not deserve it, with contumelious and unbe-
coming language. For contumely has a certain sting,
which it is very difficult for even prudent persons to en-
dure. Saul also provoked his son Jonathan with this kind
of injury, 1 Sam. xx. 30, where he breaks forth in these
words, Thou son of tlze perverse rebellious woman, do not Ι
know chat thou lzasc chosen the son of Jesse to tl'n'ne own con-
fusion, and mtto the confusion of thy mother’s nakedness?
⁷ What could be said more bitter to provoke a son than that
in order to reproach him he even reviles his own wife as a
common prostitute?
