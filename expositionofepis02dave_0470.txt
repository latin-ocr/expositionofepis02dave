all men in a state of grace and reconciliation3 or was in-
sufficient. If it is stated to be insufficient‚ we extenuate
Divine grace, and unworthily trample upon the merit of
Christ. [f itis acknowledged to be sufficient, then the
cause being placed in a sufficient act, nothing else is re-
quired to produce the effect. Therefore‚ from the act of
Christ offering up himself to God, immediately follows the
universal deliverance of all men from ,the guilt of their
sins, and the universal reconciliation or reception of all
men into the Divine favour.

REPLY. We acknowledge the most full sufficiency of
the ransom3 yea, its infinite superabundance. But we
answer, That this merit of Christ, considered in itself, ope-
rates indeed sufficiently as an universal cause of the salva-
tion of mankind ς but an universal cause does not produce
effects in individuals before there is an individual applica-
tion, Therefore as Aquinas says (Part. 3, qn. 49, art. lO,
& qu. disp. de grat. Chr. art. 7 ‚) By tlze death osC'lnist was
made a most sufficient universal cause, by means of whzclz all

thes cause mong'fests its expuit res virtue sor the delia-emme and
reconciliation of individuols, it is neeslful that z't should be ap-
pliecl to indivicluals bysaitlt. Which the Apostle himself
hath perspicuously taught, Rom. iii. 25, leom God ΙιαίΙι
setforth to be α propitiation, through faitlz z'n lzis blood, διο.
Therefore, although this death of Christ is a sufficient sa-
tisfaction for the sins of the human race, yet, since it
cleanses us from our sins after the manner of a medicine,
it must be applied to each person before it can produce the
effect of reconciliation and health. But the application is
made only by saith.

2. If God should not receive all men into favour after
having accepted a sufficient ransom, it would be an act of
injustice to Christ, because he does not bestow upon
nien what Christ by dying merited for them: He would
also act unjustly towards men, because he still holds thern
bound by their sins, as by deth, when Christ hath blot-
ted out all their debts with his blood.

Rspm. Injustice is not done to either. Not to Christ,
