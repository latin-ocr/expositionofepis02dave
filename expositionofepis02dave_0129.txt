Ver. 14. EPlsTLE To ‘rm-3 coLossmNs. 119

ing definition: Ic z's α virtue divz'nely insused, by ωΙιὶσΙι God
is sincerely lovedfor his own sake, and one’s :neighbourfor G od’s
sake. For it is the same virtue of charity, which causes us
to love God, and one’s neighbour under God and for God.

This ‘love of charity is distinguished from every vicious
love on account of its beginning. For charity fiows from
God, as a gift infused by the Holy spirit into human hearts.
Love is (ff God, 1 John iv. 7. God harh given to us the Spa:
rit (ff love, 2 Tim. i. 7. Whence Prosper, De vita con-
templ. 3. 13, says, Charity z's α regulaced will united to God,
enkiudlrd by thefire of the Holy sz'rit. But all vicious and
inordinate love arises from the fountain of innate concu-
piscence : such is the love of the avaricious, the ambitious,
the lustfu13 and, in one word, of all the wicked.

Itis distinguished also on account of its order and its Ι
olgject. For charity arises from God whom it loves for himself:
corrupt love springs from oneself. Charity proceeds to love
one's neighbour for the Lord's sake 3 corrupt love pretends to
love one's neighbour, but pursues one’s own advantage and
pleasure. Therefore, they neither agree in order nor in object.
But when itis said, Charity proceeds from God to one’s neigh-
bour, it is by no means to be restricted to relatives, kinsmen,
or our familiar friends3 but is to be extended to men univer-
sally: for every man who is in want ofour good offices, or our
assistance, is our neighbour. Luke x. 36. Hence Augus·
tine, on Psalm cxviii. Conc. 8, says, Every man is neighbour-
ιο every man ,· nor is the remoteness offamz'ly ties to be consi-
dered, where tlzere is a common natm-e. With this view the
Schoolmen say, Neighbour is to be understood not from near-
ness of blood, but fellowslzz‘p in reason. Aquinas,Quaest.disp.de
char. art. 7. But since we enlarged on this virtue of cha-
rity when treating the fourth verse of the first Chapter, we
shall pass by the rest, and proceed with its pre-eminence.

The Apostle intimates this prerogative of Charity when
he says, ἐπι vtae-1 τὸυτοις, above 'all these, as the common
translation renders it. In the figure the Apostle has taken
up he seems to compare charity to some outward garment,
which is worn over the others3 to which comparison, how-
ever, we must attend not in regard to the order, as though
