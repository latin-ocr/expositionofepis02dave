to have compassion upon angels3 he willed that the Re-
deemer should not assume the angelic nature, but the seed
of Abraham. Hence we may conclude, that the death of
Christ was not ordained as a ransom for the redemption of
angels3 but we neither can nor ought to conclude, that it
was not a ransom in itself of sufficient dignsty, value‚ and
efficacy, if it had been ordained. It might be argued on
the other hand, that Christ, notwithstanding the dissimi-
litude of nature, is a sufficient, fit, and suitable head to
communicate grace even to angeIS, from whence it is as-
serted by the most learned Divines‚ that the gifts of grace
are merited even by the good angele. Since, therefore, the
merits of Christ do not profit the evil angels, it is not to
be referred to the insufficiency of the thing. but to the
will of God alone3 and consequently, if we affirm that there
are many human beings to whom the passion and merit of
Christ is in no way ordained, as to the sufficiency of the
death of Christ, the state and condition of these will not
be different from that of the devils.

death of Christ was paid for the whole human race, and
who limit it to the elect alone. Thus Piscator* (in Respv
Apologet. Sec. 87), It cannot be said, Thac Christ died jbr
all mankind sufficiently, because it wouldfollow that he died
for all, the contrary to which is demonstrated. And in the
same place, leat distinction which is made, Thai Christ died

Strasburg, in 1546. He was successively a Lutheram a Calvinist, and an
Arminian. But his attainments in divinity became so celebrated, that he
was invited to accept the Professor's Chair at Herborn, which he filled with
such effect as to draw many students thither from different parts of Europe.
He was very diligent and laborious; translated the Bible into German, and
was the author of Commentaries on the Old and New Testaments‚ which
are said to be valuable. His works were collected in four Vols. folio. He
