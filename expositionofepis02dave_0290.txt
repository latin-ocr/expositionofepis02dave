4. That they both act basely, who seek their own ad·-
vantage by works of charity, and instead of the duty of
salutation perform one of adulation. In this they sin, who
neglect others, and by these offices of humanity court the

even in prison and bonds.

than to suffer persecution for the sake of righteousness
i aud the Gospel. Hence Paul was not ashamed either of
