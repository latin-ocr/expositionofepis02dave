have despised and rejected this so great benefit. Luke X.
11, and 2 Thess. i. 8. All these things shew that the
Gospel is a supernatural benefit granted even to those who
abuse it. Secondly, if any one should obstinately deny
that the preaching of the Gospel is a benefit granted by
God to the non-elect3 yet no one would deny, that the
enlightem'ng of tlze mind, tasting of the heaveuly gfft, commu-
nication of other supernatural gifts, which are mentioned
in Hebrews vi. are {great and supernatural benefits, and
conferred not for this corporeal, but for that spiritual life.
But all these things are frequently given to those who are
not of the number of the elect3 and they are given through
and for the sake of Christ: For, Out of hissulness have all
we received (John i. 16), and, To every one of us is given
grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Ephes.
vi. 7. Moreover, of some supernatural gifts we rightly·
say with the Apostle, All these worlcetlz that one and tlte seff-
same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. l Cor.
xii. 11. To which I add, thatever supernatural grace is
given through Christ to any man, is given from the merit
of Christ: sor Christ does not confer any thing upon men
which hc hath not first merited for them by his obedience.
Thus Bernard says (Serm. 13 in Cant.), Whatsoever wisdom,
whatsoever virtue you think you have, attribute it to Christ, the
virtue of God, the wz'sdomof God. The source offountaz'ns
and rivers is the sea .· the source of virtue and knowledge is our
Lord Jesus Christ. Ambrose speaks more generally on
Ephesians i. Every gift (ff the grace os God z's in Christ.
Lastly, even this is clear, that, in the opinion at least of
all the antients, the death of Christ is, from the ordina-
tion of God, applicable also to the non-elect, because they
expressly taught that it was applied iu baptism for the re-
mission of original sin to every baptised infant. Here is
a principal and supernatural effect of the death of Christ,
of the application os which to the non-predestinate there
was no doubt in the antient Church, not even among those
who held absolute predestination most rigidly. A very
important witness to this is Prosper himself (Resp. 2. ad
Capit. Gallor. δι Sentent. 2. on the same capitula.) Το
