natural and spiritual concupiscence.v For there is a three-
fold concupiscence: Natura13 which comprehends the de-
siring power planted in the mind by God himself, and go-
verning the ordinary motion of the same: vicious or car-
nal; whi'ch denotes the inordinateness and rebellious mo-
tion of this power: spiritual3 which denotes a new and
holy inclination of a reformed mind, of which concupis-
cence the Apostle speaks, Gal. v. 17, lee Spirz't lustetlz or
desiretlz against tlz-eflesh. Natural concupiscence, when it
is carried to its due object and in a due manner, is to be
gratified: spiritual, which tends to heavenly things, is to
be nourished and cherished: carnal, which is likewise
called evil, because it thirsts inordinately and after inor-
dinate things, is to be mortified. Hence we may derive-
two lessons ;

1. A Christian man ought to aim even at that perfection
which he understands he cannot attain in this life. For no
sinner hath ever been able to mortify and restrain all the
first motions of inordinate concupiscence3 yet all are
bound to attempt it: for that Divine mandate stands im-
moveable, Thou skalt not covet. Concerning which, Au-
gastina* Epist. 200, ad Asellicum, truly said, lee law, in
declaring thou skalt not cot-et, llas laid down ηοι· the power
which we have in this particular, bat tlte object at wlciclz we
should advance progressively.

2. Those first motions of inordinate desires are sins,
though the mind does not assent to them. Bellarmin,
therefore, is wrong, who concludes, in De stat. pecc. 5. 7,
that that rebellious motion of concupiscence has the na-
ture, not of gm'lt, but ofpunislzment. Why does the Apos-
tle call it evil? Why does he say it isto he mortffied? He
is not wont to speak thus about punishments3 which he
teaches us are to be borne patiently‚ not to be mortified or
resisted. Let the Jesuit hear Paul, who in Rom. vii. not
once, but often, terms inordinate concupiscence siu, even
in the regenerate who consent to the law, and oppose these
motions. Let him also hear Augustine, lib. 5, contra
