Ver-4. EPlSTLE To THE COLOSS¹ANS. 27

to a contest of running with certain plebeians, said, that
it was not befitting the son of a king to enter the course
except with kings. It behoves us also to maintain this
royal temper, and to resolve that we cannot, in conformity
with the‘ dignity of our condition, engage with worldly
minded men in the contest for earthly things3 but that we
ought so to frame our course with the sons of God and co-
heirs of heaven, as to seek and obtain heavenly things.
This is what Christ advised3 Talse no thought, saysing, what
shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or wherewz'thal shall we
be clothed ? sor after all these things do the Gentiles seelc: but
seelc ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, Matt.
vi. 31. A saint, while he seelcs after eterm'ty alone, holds be-
neoth him every thing transitor-y, says Gregory, Moral l.
3. 14.

Seeondly, if we seriously consider who is the bestower
of this glorious crown, that likewise will excite us to des-
pise earthly things. Christ our life, as we before shewed,
promised it, he merited it, he will assign this crown of
glory: But to whom? to those who seek and delight in earth-
ly things? By no means3 but to those who sech the things
that are above, and love his appearing, 2Tim. iv. 8. Itis
proper to expect the reward from him for whom you have
fought: if for the world, the flesh, or the devil, expect no
other reward than death ε if for Christ, then, and then
only, it will be lawful to hope for glory in the end: He who
sowech to the flesh shall of the flesh νεαρ corrupti0n; but he
who sowelh to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlast-
ing, Gal. vi. 8. Admirably spake Bernard : There is no road
to the kingdom, without thefirst-sruits osthe kingdom‚· nor can
that man hope for the kingdom qs heaven, who has not yet ob-
tained the dominion over his own lusis. So 1 John iii. 2, 3,
When Christ shall appear, we shall be like him : And whosoever
hath this hope in him purffieth. himser even as he z's pure. But
Christ was as pure from the lusts of earthly things as could
possibly be: for he would not yield the least inclination of
his body to the devil, to obtain thereby all the lcingdonzs of
this world and the glory of them, Matt. iv. Thus we ought

to be animated, if we expect life eternal from Christ our
life.
