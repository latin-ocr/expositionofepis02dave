which we might claim as peculiar to us, and our own, it is
sin and corruption, not merit and righteousness.

10. The mind of sensual man lies wholly sunk in earth-ly
things, neither is he able to raise himself heavenward before
grace be infused: for the members of our soul, i. e. the
inclinations and affections, are of the earth, earthly, or af-
fixed to the earth reaturally; and, indeed, are not raised
towards heaven except by grace exciting· them.
