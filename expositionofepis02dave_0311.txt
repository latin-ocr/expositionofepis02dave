Ver. 16. EplsTLE ‘ro THE COLOSSlANs. 301

Scriptures itself conduces to the edification ofa Christian
people in faith and charity, unless there be added at the
same time an illustration and exposition of them by a
preacher. Far be it from us to detract froin the utility or
necessity of preaching3 nevertheless‚ we assert with the
Psalmi‘st, concerning the word of God read studiously and
devoutly‚ T lte law of tlze Lord is peffect, converting the soul .·
the testimony (ff the Lord is sure, making wise the simple,
Psal. xix. 7.

2. (lause that ic be read also in the Church of the Laodi-
ceans] This is the second command of the Apostle, in
which the Colossians are ordered to communicate this
Epistle to the Laodiceans.

A twofold reason may be offered for this command:
One3 because the doctrine of this Epistle is general, and
on that account was not to be reserved for the private use·
of one Church, but to be communicated to the whole
Church of God 3 but first to the neighbours of the Colos-
sians, who having read the autograph, could take copies
of it, and diffuse them through the whole Church of God.

The other reason is; Because (as it is very likely) this
Church on account of its vicinity‚was opposed in the same
manner as the Church of Colosse, by those Jewish and
philosophical seducere: therefore, lest there should be a
necessity for a new Epistle, the Apostle would have this
made common to both.

Hence observe, That among all the Churches of God,
but especially among neighbouring ones, there ought to
be a communication of spiritual benefits3 so that if one
Church should have any thing that might contribute to the
edification of another, it should not grudge to impart it.

3. And tlzat γε lilcewz'se read the Epistlefwm Laodicea]
We have in these words the last particular of the Apos-
tolic command3 which enjoins that a certain Epistle sent
from Laodicea should be read in the Church of the Colos-
sians. Itis probable that the Laodiceans had written to
Paul concerning the state of their affairs, and that the
Epistle contained something in it which was very useful to
be known by the Colossians: Hence the Apostle ordered
it to be read by them.
