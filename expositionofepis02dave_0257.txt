Ver. 4. Evis‘rLE To THE corossmns. 247*

cause the Apostle, in Ephes. vi. 20, (where these things
are accurately described) expressly mentions this παρρησιας,
or liberty of speaking. Neither can the legitimate preach-
ing of the word consist without this liberty3 because the
end of preaching ls, to cast down and subvert every thing that
exalts ztself against the Divine tr,uth or will, by the spiritual
weapons eff the Gospel, as says the Apossse, 2 Cor. Χ. 5.

Therefore. we ought not to preach sn ooth things, and,
from a certain cowardly sear, withhold salutary ones: but
those errors and sins which especially reign even in and
among the greatest, are to be reproved. So God com—
mands, Isa. lvi-ii. 1, Laefc up thy voice lilre α trumpet. and
shew ‘my people their transgressions. Thus the prophet Ho-
sea freely censured the vices of the princes and priests,
Chap. v. l. Well and piously said Prosper, De vita con-⁴
templ. li'b. 3. cap. 23, We ought to be more willing to restrain
their enmffies, who are unwilling to be amended, tltcm to igtcar
the displeasure of God wln'lst we flatter sz'nners. For they
cure and heal those bitters, although they exasperate the pas-
sim-13, as Clemens rightly remarks in Protrept.

Neither ought we, either in the doctrines themselves, or
in the forms and modes of speaking, to accommodate our-
selves to the errors of others to the prejudice of known
truth: which timorous persons often do against their con-
science, especially among those whom they imagine to in-
cline some little towards the Popish errors. But this is
opposed to that liberty which is required in Christian mi-
nisters3 who onght not only to retain the very substance
(so to speak) and possession of the nuth, but even to de-
fend its remote bounds and confines as it were. Hence the
Apostle commands us to retain, not only sozmd doctrine, but
also tlzeform of sozmd words. And prudently does Gerson
advise theologians to avoid extraneous terms in the doctriueqf
truth, part. l. De exam. doctr. consid. i. For that oft re-
peated saying of Jerome is true, Heresy arisessrom. words
inappropriately used. Thus much of this wappncrca—this li-
berty of speaking.

2. YVe ought to preach the word of God constantly and
diligently. So says the Apostle, Rom. xii, 7, He to whom·
