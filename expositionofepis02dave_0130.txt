120 AN nxrosvrioN OF s'r. PAUL’s (ympni.

charity was to be put on last of all the virtues before-men-
tioned3 but with regard to the comprehensiveness of the
similitude.

1. As an onter garment is generally wider and larger
than the rest3 so does charity exceed the before-mentioned
virtues.

2. As that garment which is worn outermost is general-
ly more beautiful and costly than therest3 so does cha-
rity among the other virtues shine like the moon among
the stars.

3. As the ranks and degrees of men are generally dis-
tinguished by the outer garment3 so charity serves to dis-
criminate the true disciples of Christ and sons of God from
false and pretended ones. So John xiii. 35, By this shall
all men know tlzat με are my disciple3‚ if με have love one to
another.

Calvin reads, on account os all these things put οη charit-y.
The Greek word επι, signifies both over and because ff(super
et propter); and either way serves to illustrate the excel-
lence of charity. For if the Apostle has commanded them

on account of all these virtues also to put on charity, he
wished to shew that neither they nor their actions could
subsist without charity.

For first, they have their truth, and, consequently, their
velue, from charity3 as the Apostle sayS‚ 1 Cor. xiii. 3,
T lzough I bestow all my goods to seed the poor, and though I

give my body to be burned, and have not maritvs, it p'rcy‘c'tetlz
me nothing. Many marvellous properties are to be found
in men, says Prosper, which without having tlze marrow of
charito, put on tlte appearance ofpz‘ety‚ but have not its realz'ty.

Secondly, they have their actions from charity: for in
those points which regard our neighbour, she is as it were
the mistress of the other virtues, and causes them as her
servants to perform her tasks. On this account their pro-
perties and actions are attributed to charity. Clzarz'ty is
long-szfferz'ng, διο. l Cor. xiii. 4, segfferetlz all things, believetlz
all things, lzopetlz all things ; vers. 7, ib. This is what the
Schoolmen mean when they tell us that charity produces
