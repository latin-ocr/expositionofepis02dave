Ver. ll. EPISTLE To THE cotossmNs. 91

,syc are of yourfather the devil, &c vers. 44. On the other
hand, if the Gentiles were renewed and sanctified, they are
shewn to be acceptable to God. See Acts x. 34, Osa truth
I perceive that God is no respecler qf persons,· but in every
nation ‘he that seareth him and worlceth rz‘ghteousness is accepted
‘tuith him. And Gal. iii. 7, They which are officim, the same
are children of Abraham. Jerome says, Ic· is not the sons of
the saints, who obtain the places Qf the saints, but those who
perform their worhs. This is an effective argument against
the impudence of the Romanists, who measure a member
of the Church by this point alone, viz. that he does or does
not adhere to the Papal chair. But Christ asks not whe-
ther he adhere to this or that national church‚ but to the
true saith ‘3 not whether he be a Romanist, but whether he
be renewed and sanctified [² In the spiritual state, whether·
a man be a Greek or a Jew is not regarded 3 much less whe-
ther he be a Greek or a Romanist. ἱ

Circumcision nor uncircumcz‘sz‘on.] As in the business of
salvation the difference of nations affords neither preroga-
tive nor prejudice3 by similar reasoning the difference of
ceremonies and external observances is of no moment.
Circumcision was in the Jewish' church the chief religious
rite: it was used, therefore, to express the observance of
all the legal rites, and uncircumcision argued the neglect
of them. The Apostle, then, affirms, that neither the ob-
servation nor neglect of all the outward ceremonies is of
any moment to Christians3 but that internal renovation
and true holiness contain the sum of our salvation.

The Christian is not commended to God by the obser-
vance of certain ceremonies or external traditions3 neither
is he alienated from God by the mere omission of the same.
So Paul constantly teaches: Gal. vi. 15, In Christ Jesus
neither cz'rcmncz‘sz'on availeth any thing, nor uncircnmcision, but
a new creature. Rom. xiv. 2, 3, One believeth that he may
eat all things ,· another who is wealc cateth lzerbs. Let not him
that eatech despise him tlzac cateth not ,· and let not him which
cateth notjudge hz'm that eateth. He lays down the same
rule as to the observance of days in vers. 5. But more
clearly in l Cor. viii. S, But meat commendeth us ‘not to God,
