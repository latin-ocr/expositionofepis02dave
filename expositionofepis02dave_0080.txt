70 AN nxrosimoN Op s‘r. PAUL's Chap. iii.

phemy, Levit. xxiv. 16, which we read in ver. 23, was in-
flicted on the blasphemer. But since in this place the
Apostle seems to point out not that blasphemy whereby
the Divine Majesty is assailed, but that whereby men are
injured, dismissing this blasphemy of the Divine name, let
us pass on to that other.

We say, then, that to this evil speaking which assaults
one's neighbour, the epithet of blasphemy is also applied
not only in this but in many places of Scripture. For in-
stance, in Rom. iii. 8, As we be slanderously reported, &c-
1 Cor. iv. 13, Being defamed, we entreat, &c- Tit. iii. 2,
Put them in mind lo spealc evil cycno mam* This blasphemy
of one's neighbour arises from that anger and wrath of the
heart which the Apostle has advised us above to lay aside.
For the beart by tlte bitter gall of malice, cannot through its
instrument the longae, scatter any thing but bitters, as Ber-
nard truly says, But it has no kind of vengcance so ready
as this of evil-speaking.

This evil-speaking kind of blasphemy hath a double way
of injury: one secret, called detraction; the other open,
called railing. Rash and angry persons take the open
course of injury3 the crafty and malicious prefer the se-
cret one. Let us consider how grievously both sin. And
the grievousuess of this sin is evident‚

First, from the magnitude of the injury done to the
neighbour who is evil spoken of: For they wound his re-
putation, which is a principa} external blessing: nor is it
easy to repair this injury by any just satisfacti0n3 since
here the quantity of loss cannot be estimated, which may
be done in the taking away of other external matters.

Secondly‚ from the magnitude of the injury done to
those who hear and take up those reports of evil speakers:
For by these means, charity towards their neighbour is
put an end to with them3 hatreds, suspicions, contentions‚
and sometimes strifes are the consequence. Which incon-
venience we read happened to Saul and David by the ef-

* The same word is used in the original Greek and in the Vulgateiu each
of these passages. viz. blaspheme.
