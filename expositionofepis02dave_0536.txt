High. Priest is the M'ecliator (ff α better corenam, which was
established upon better promises, But what are those better
promises which Christ the Mediator hath established?
They are recounted verse 10, in the words which are re-
corded by Jeremiah, and are divided into two heads, into
a promise of inward reformation (ff the laearts, and of gra·
mitons remission. ossius, as Calvin has well observed on this
