sufferings. [f I have waslzed your feet, ye ouglzc also to wssslt
one another’s feet .- jbr I have given you an example, John xiii·
14. Christ hatlz sufferedsor us, leaving us an example, 1 Pet.
ii. 21. He that saz'tlz [ιε abideth in him, ought himself also so
to walle, ‘even as lze wallced, l John ii. 6. The example of
Christ has, moreover. the force of a rule in directing us,
inasmuch as it contains the most perfect model of virtue.
Hence Bernard says, What lzave you to clo with virtues, who
are ignorant os tlte virtues (gf Christ ? VVhere, I beseecle, you,
will yefind true prudence, bnt in tlze doctrine ‹y‘Chrisc ? where
trae temperance, but in the lise of Christ? Where truesorti-
tude, hat in the passion of Clu-ist? But let us evince this
in our acts of forbearing and forgiving: in which we have a
perfect rule for imitation, whether we regard what Christ
bore and forgave‚ or from whom, or, in fine, in what man· ⁴
ner he bore and forgave.

As to wlzat he bore and forgave? It-was curses, and

those the most grievous and bitter: for he was called a
glutton and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sin-
ners‚ one possessed of a devil, one using the assistance of
(leemons, amadman, a blasphemer, an impostor ς* and, in
fine, what not? He suffered evil entreatment too, being
spit upon, being beaten with rods, lastly, being crucified.
Yet all these so many and so great injuries he bore and
forgave.
· From whom? From the chiefs of the people, from the
people themselves, from the ignorant, from the wicked‚
from strangers and from countrymen, from Jews and Gen-
tiles3 in short, being injured by every description of men,
he bore with them all, he pardoned them all.

In what manner? Not from such infirmity as rendered
him unable to resist3 but from humility and voluntary
obedience‚ which made him willing to suffer. Isa. liii.
73 Matt. xxvi. 53. Not with a treacherous and deceitful
intention, meditating and seeking future vengeance3 but
with a pure heart inflamed with love, intreating from God
the Father a gracious forgiveness sor his enemies; Luke
