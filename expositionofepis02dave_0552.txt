mz'es he might make thcmfriends. A little after, Thus, there-
fore, Christ died as lo time for the migrastis, but as to pre·-
destination for his brethren andfrz'ends; which is the same
as if 116 had said, That Christ in dying on the cross had a
singular respect to the predestinate, his future brethren
and friends.

But passing from the antients, let us descend to the
Schoolmen and modern Popish writers„ who, while they
contend that Christ died for all, at the same time acknow-
ledge that he died for the elect alone, with special inten-
tion of applying his death to them, iu order to the infal-
lible attainment of eterna] life.

Tsssr. l. Let us begin with the Master of the School-
men, Peter Lombard: Christ offered himself οη the crossfor
all men, as to the sufficiency <ff the price, butsor the elect only
as to z'ts efficacffi· because he brings salvation to the predestz'nate
alone (lib. 3, dist. 20, lit. E.) The argument which he ad-
joins, why Christ is said to have died for the elect alone as
to its efficacy, is most worthy of notice. For he does not
say with the Pelagians and Aruiinians, that they alone were
foreseen to be excited by grace to apply Christ to them-
selves, according to the freedom of their own will; but that
he effected salvation in them alone through the benignity
of his special mercy. Now what he has effected in the
elect, without doubt he determined to effect in them.
And this is that special intention according to which we
profess that the death of Christ referred and was ordained
for the elect alone.

TEST. 2. Aquinas says, (part. 3, qu. 24, art. 4,) God
fore-ordained our salvation, by predestinating from etei-nites
that z't should be completed through Jesus Clzrz'st. Aquinas
speaks of the elect, and asserts that God ordained, from
eternity, >that their salvation should be infallibly completed
through Jesus Christ. I ask, then, how Christ exhibited
himself as conformed to the eternal appointment of his
Father, if, in his saving passion, he had not applied his
merits in a peculiar manner infallibly to effect and com-
plete the salvation of the elect? It is granted, then, that
the special intention of God in accepting this sacrifice,
