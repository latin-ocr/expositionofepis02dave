ness of God by human conjectures, contend that he supplies
the gratuitous means ofsalvation to all who make use oftheir
natural endowmeuts either aright or not badly, but denies
them to others who have abused the same gifts, (as Augus-
tine says) being ignorant (ff the lzeiglzc and depth of Divine
grace, form inzprobnblefables. When-ier, therefore, we will
or not, if the cause is sought Why those means, by which
they may apply Christ to themselves for salvation, are
granted to some individuals, and not to others, we must
overlook the disparity of men, or of human works, and
ascend to the free good pleasure of God, as Prosper ele-
gantly observes, (Carmine. de Ingratis. cap. 35) Since tlte
same cause equally implicates all, they ανε not to be distin-

ARGUMENT 3. From the fact we argue thus as to the'
right3 God does not omit to do any thing, which it would
be an impeachment upon Divine goodness, justice, or wis- ,
dom not to do. This cannot be doubted, since it is impos·-

mitted, yet God has heretofore denied, and does now deny
to many nations and many individuale, those means with-

will evidently appear, whether we consider the immediate
means of salvation by which man is placed in a state of
spiritual life and salvation, and in the actual participation
of the death and merits of Christ, such as repentance, faith,
regeneration, and sanctificati0n3 or whether we regard the
external means, which, as instruments‚ God makes use of
to produce the former, such as the sending of teachers and
pastors, the preaching of the Gospel, and all other helps,
without which those internal and immediate means of sal-
vation cannot ordinarily be produced. With respect to the
former, faith and a saving knowledge of Christ, is a spe-
cial gift, granted to some, denied to others, according to
the good pleasure of the Divine will. It is given untoyoa
