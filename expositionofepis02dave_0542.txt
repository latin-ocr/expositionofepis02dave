Christ specially and effectually put up for the elect, had
its foundation in the oblation‚ in which he specially and
effectually offered up himself for them. Observe the force
of the argument3 Whatever Christ obtains for individual
persons by his special intercession‚ that he merited for
them with the Father by the offering of himself which per-
tained to them especially: But by his intercession he ob-

Therefore he specially offered himself for them, that he
might infallibly procure for them these benefits. [doubt

he hath not decreed salvation by such a will, neither was
