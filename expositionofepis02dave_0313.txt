Ver. 16. EPISTLE To THE cotossmxs. 303

of the Scriptures rested upon the judgment of the Church;
which thus could exclude the writings of the Apostles
themselves from the number of the sacred books. The
ambiguity of the Latin version, which gives the passage
thus, Eam quse Laodicensium est vos legatis, and tlzotye read
that whiclz is of the Laodiceam ; and the bold dishonesty of
a certain impostor, who put forth a certain forged epistle
under the title of Paul to the Laodiceam, have given occa-
sion to this error. ssut I answer, that no one ever ac-
counted that epistle for a genuine Epistle of Paul, except
Stapleton, and those like him, who are used to serape to-
gether from every quarter arguments to set the authority of
the Chureh above the Scriptures. OEcumenius in this
place observes, He has not said that To the Laodiceam, buc
that FRoM Laodicea, which Theodoret also *had observed
before him. As to that which Stapleton (relying upon
this passage) desires to hold for a genuine Epistle of Paul3
I wonder at the impudent stupidity of the man, since-that
has already been rejected by all the Fathers who have
mentioned it. Theodoret in this place, calls it afiction and
forgerffy. Jerome in his Catalogue of Ecclesiastical writers,
where he reckons up all Paul's Epistles, at length subjoins
these words, Some read ond to the Laodiceans; but it is ex-
ploded by all. Lastly, the Qd Nicene Council‚ Act 6. says,
Among the Epistles <ff the divine Apostle a certain one is spo-
lcen os to tlte Laodiceam, wlziclz our Fathers have reproboted
as another mon's. That opinion, therefore, is consonant
both to the Greek context and to truth, which we have
propounded from the beginning3 that an epistle from the
Laodiceans to Paul was here meant, not one on the con-
trary part. And the opinion of Stapleton is to be de-
tested, who determines that it was an Epistle of Paul him-
self, which all the Fathers have rejected as a forgery and
unworthy of attention: Nor is the conclusion more sound,
which he would deduce therefr0m3 namely, that the Church
had authority to exclude sioni the canon a true and genu-
ine Epistle of the Apostle Paul. Thus much of the thr-ee
sold command of the Apostle.

ln those two verses which remain, he bids them to ad-
mouish Archippus to fulfil his ministry3 and, introducing
