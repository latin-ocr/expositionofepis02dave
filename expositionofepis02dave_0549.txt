justified. As if he had said, That God, according to a spe-
cial decree of mercy, sent Christ to deliver and save the
predestinate effectually and infallibly3 in which sense they
alone are called vessels of mercis.

It would be useless to produce more passages from Au-
gustine, whose opinion of the absolute predestinatiou of
some to eternal life. and of the eternal giving of them to
Christ the Mediator, that they might be by him infallibly
led to the same, is known to all who are conversant with
his writings. What is meant by predestination, and giving
and leading to eternal life, without this special design of
applying his death and merits to them, can neither be uu·
derstood nor imagined. See cap. 18, de praed. Sanct. cap.
7, de bono persev. cap. 9, de cor. ὃς grat.

TEsT. 4. The fourth testimony may be derived from
Ambrose, whose words are these (lib. 6, cap. 7, Luke3)
Altlzouglz Clzrist suffereclfor all, yet he suffered specially ‘for
us, because he suffer·ed]or his clzarclz .· therefore it is not to be
doubted tlzat much is due from ltz'm who lzatlz received much.
Here we see that, according to the opinion of Ambrosc,
Christ in suffering had a special regard to his church, from
whence it followed that she received the special benefit of
that passion of Christ. Therefore he asserts, that Christ
suffered for all ς but so that the will and intention of Christ
in suffering does not equally regard all men, but is di-
rected in some singular manner towards his mystical body,
that is, the church of the first-born, which he willed to
acquire for himself with his own blood and to unite to
himself by his Spirit, in order to the infallihle participa-
tion of eternal life. He did not suffer for all men with this
special intention.

TEs'r. 5. Remi, Bishop of Rheims, may follow Ambrose.
He writes thus on Rom. v'iii„ Wleom lze predestinatecl or
