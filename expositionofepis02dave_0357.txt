God slzouldfirsc liove been spoken to you ; but seez'ugye put it
from you, and jndge yourselves unworthy of everlasting lffie,
lo Ι we turn to tlze Gentiles. From which words it is evident,

Christ‘s stead, be με reconciled to God, It is to be observed
in the first place, That the Apostle here lays down what
he calls reconciliation procured from God through the me-
diation of Christ, as a common benefit for the whole world.
And indeed to leave reconciled tlze world generally can mean
nothing else than to have ordained and granted to the
world that universal remedy or propitiatory sacrifice of the
death of Christ, which is applicable to all, Secondly, It
is proper to obser-ve, in what sense God is said actually to
lzave reconciled tlzc world lo himself, by the merit of the
