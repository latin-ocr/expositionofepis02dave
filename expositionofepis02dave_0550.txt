540 Α DISSERTA'I'lON ΟΝ THE DEATH OF CHRlST,

lisa—All these shew that Christ suffered for the elect and
the elect alone, with a certain purpose of saving them;
which is the special intention that we endeavour to esta-
blish, and whith we contend is to be limited to the elect
alone in this oblation of Christ.

Tsss-r. 6. Fulgentius says <De incarn. ὃς grat. Jesu.Chr.
cap. 29, p. 92, Biblioth. Patr. tom. 6,) ΤΙιοεε wlzo think that
the will of God, by wlziclz he wills tlte salvation of all men, is
equal towards the redeemed ond the condemieed ,· when they ore
asked, why God wills that all men should be saved, ancl yet all
are not saved, what will they answer? The learned Fulgen-
tius intimates, that God of his special will hath determined
that the salvation of those who are actually saved should
be procured by Christ, and that those who affirm the con-
trary have nothing solid to answer when they are urged to
shew from whence this distinction arises, that some are
really saved by the death of Christ, and others are not
saved. He demonstrates that this cannot be referred to
the human will (cap. 30 and 31).

TEsT. 7. Ι add another testimony of the same Fulgen-
tius, (lib. 3, de verit. Praedest.) lese whom God hatlz pre·
destz'nated to the adoption os som, no Christian ought co doubt

not doubt that the elect children of God were predesti-
nated both to grace and glory before the formation of the
world, will willingly confess, that the death and merit of
Christ was ordained and accepted in some special way for
these elect persons, that from thence they might infallibly
obtain the grace and glory destined for them.
