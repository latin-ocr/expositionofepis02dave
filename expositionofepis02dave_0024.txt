14 AN exroslrioN or ετ. PAUL’S Clzap. iii.

And thus ye see briefly in what sense Christ is set at the
right hand of God: His Divine nature, or the person of
the W0rd‚ sits in the equality of Majesty and glory, and of
’ all the Divine attributes3 the human nature sits above all
created things, but yet beneath God, viz. endued with
majesty, and the greatest glory adapted to it, and of which
it can be capable.

T'hose things being explained, it remains that we shevv
the force. of this argument: Christ sitteth on high at the
right hand of God3 therefore we ought to seek and affect
the things which are above. There are two reasons which
strengthen this consequence. The first derived from the
love of ,all the faithful to the Head and Saviour Christ
Jesus. It is a common saying‚ lee mind is where it loves, not
where its actual seat is .· and that saying in the Gospel 'is also

ν’ well known, leere the treasure is, there will the beart be

also, Matt. vi. 21. Since then Christ, who is the love and
delight of the souls of the faithful, is placed in the hea-

and holy soul to fiee towards that celestial place as by a
straight course, and in heart and mind especially to have
conversation there daily. That saying of Paul, Phil. i. 23,

this affection. The inferior members can never be well if
they be disjointed and separated from their head ε it is no
wonder, therefore, if all the faithful mount to heaven as
much as they can, and strive to join themselves to Christ
their Head.

The other cause is derived from the influence of the head
over the members. For Christ sits not idle at the right hand
of the Father, but imparts saving grace to all his people, and
supplies them with strength to trample under foot earthly
things, and seek those which are above. For Christ being
-= exalted hath attract1ve virtue,he draws all his people upward,
and suffers them not to cleave to the earth. Even as the hea-
venly sun draws upwards by his power, gross and earthly va-
pours ; so Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, separates our
gross and rigid souls from the dregs of earthly things, and
by his efficacious working raises them to heavenly. The
argument, therefore, isv derived from what is possible or
