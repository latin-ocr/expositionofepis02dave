514 A DissERTATioN ΟΝ THE DEATH OF CHRIST.

under this universal virtue of the death of Christ, which
extends to all rational creatures, we should destroy its
special efficacy, Which actually pertains to the predes-
tinated alone, we shall enter upon the other part of the
discussion we undertook, which will explain and defend
the special prerogative of the elect in the death of Christ,
both from the will of God the Father in giving his Son to
death, and that of the Son in offering himself. For we
ought not so to contend that Christ died for all, as to be-
lieve with the Pelagians, that the quickening efficacy of
his death is at the same time common to all, from the in-
tention of the Divine will, but in its event becomes saving
to some and not to others, no otherwise than from the
contingent use of human liberty. Nor are we to fancy
with the Arminians‚ that God gave his Son to death abso-
lutely intending nothing more than tlzatsrom thence ἦε might
have a mere power of saving some sinners, notwithstanding his
justice, and tlzat any sinners might have α way or means by
which they might be saved, notwithstanding llzeir own sin.
Hence arises that celebrated corollary of Grevinehoviusf’t
in his dissertation on the death of Christ (p. 9,) That the
dl'gm'ty, necessitas, and usefulness os redemption might alum-
dantly appear by its being obtained, even (lzouglz it should
never be actually applied to any individnal. Again (p. 14,)
Thac tlte redemption might be obtainedfor all, and yet applied
to none on account of their anbelz'eff. But we by no means
think that the death of Christ was like the cast of dice,
but that it was decreed from eternity by God the Father

θ’ To what has been observed respecting Grevinchovius at p. 304, it may
be added, that he took an active part in the controversy between the Cal-
vinists and Arminians in Holland. Resides various publications written in
the Dutch Language, he wrote (in reply to William Ames's Disceptatio Scho-
lastica cle A rmtnii sententia, qud electionem omnem particularem fidei praevisae docet
inniti, Amst. 1593, 4to.) Dissertatio de duabus quaestz'onibus hoc tempore conto-0-
versis ; quarum prima est de Reconciliatione per mortem Christi impetrasti omnibus
et singulis hominibus .· altera, (te electione enfide previsa. Roterodami, 1595, 4to.
To this treatise Ames rejoined, as the Reader will have observed in the
early part of the 4th Chapter of this Dissertatimi, in a Boset-iptio Scholastica,
published at Leyden⁷ in 1597, 121110. (Ji'alchz'i Bibliotheca leeologica, tom.
II. pp. 543, 544. 548, 549.)
