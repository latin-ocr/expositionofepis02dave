853 AN nxrosmuon or ετ. PAUL'S Cleap. iii,

adopted sone, itis not accurately remarked in Scripture. For
as he is called the image of the Fatlzer, Heb.i. 33 so we
also are said to be not only made in the image, but tlte
image cs God, l Cor. xi. 7. We must, however, hold, that
Christ is the image of God the Father in one way3 we in
another: He is the image by equality, having entirely the
same nature with the Father of whom he is the image;
every regenerated person is the image by imitation, partially
representing a certain similitude to the Divine nature in
some gifts of grace. Angustiae illustrates this by no in-
apt simile: As tlte image of an Emperor, says he, upon a
coin diſjers from that in liis son ; so does tlte image cf God in
us differ from that in Christ.

Secondly, the Schoolmen and Fathers inquire in what
this image of God after which we are created, consists;
and the consideration of this more nearly concerns our
present purpose. Tertullian, in his treatise against Mar-
cion, lib. 2, determines it in immortalily,freedom ofwill,
and tlte capacity qs knowledge. Angustiae, in 9 de Trin.⁴
cap. 4, assigns the image of God in the soul as consisting
in these three things, mind, understanding‚ and affictionsff‘
but in 1 de Trin. cap. ll, as memory, intellect, and tlte will.†
The Schoolmen sor the most part say, this image of God
consists in natural gifts ; but the likeness in gijts of grace;
and the Gloss upon Genesis expresses this opinion, in say-
ing that man was made after tlze image of God, as to natu-
ral qualities: after lzz's likeness, as to qualicies of grace. ·We
allow, with the Fathers and Schoolmen, that a certain
image of God is found in the natural faculties of the mind,
which may be called the image qs the natural creation; but
nevertheless we affirm, both in this passage and every other
of Paul, that this image of God (which may be called the
image of tlze supernatural re-creatimt) is not placed in the
powers, faculties, or qualities themselves of the native
soul; but in the re-arrangement‚ sanctificat-ion, and confir-
mation of these according to the nature and will of God.
