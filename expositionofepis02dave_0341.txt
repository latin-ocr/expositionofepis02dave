themas. Among other things he pronounces an anathema
upon those who teach that Christ had not died for 611. At
the close of this epistle he commands Lucidus to send it
back to him subscribed with his own hand3 and thu-eatenis,
if he should refuse, that he would accuse him before the
Synod of Arles, which was then sitting, and had sub-
scribed these letters and anathemas of Faustus. Lucidus
being frightened at this thundering epistle‚ subscribed it,
and thus condemned with his own hand the opinion which
he had promulgated. A short time afterwards, the Synod
of Leyden was assembled‚ which added some things to the
decrees of the former Commii, to which also Lucidus
ysielded his assent. There is extant an epistle of Lucidus
to this Synod of Leyden, in which he condemns those who
say, leat Christ om· Saviour did not emim-e death for the sal-
vation of all men ; and, according to the new mode of
preaching established in this Council, he asserts, Tlmt
Christ our Sariour, according to the rit-hes qs his goqclness,
szgffiered deathfor all men. Both of these letters are extant
111 the Bibliotheca Patrum (p. 3. tom. 5), the names also of
the Bishops being subscribed who are thought to have
been at these councils. But the things which are boasted
of in the name of these councils are not of much moment,
since for the most part they rest merely on the veracity of
the heretic Faustus. For if you set aside these letters of
Faustus, you may in vain seek elsewhere the afore-men—
tioned decrees of the Council of Arles, as they are no
where else to be found. Nor can those new deorees about
preaching, of which Lucidus speaks in his epistle, be
found among the canons of any Council of Leyden. The
veracity of Faustus in these things is further diminished,
because he seems to intimate in his Epistle to Leontiusss*
that those books on grace and free-will, which are so full
of poisonous sentiments, were not only written by the di-
16611011 of this Council of Leyden, but were also approved
of by it. And moreover, he pretends that 116 inserted
nothing in this writing besides the opinion of this Synod.
