ritoriously‚ or morally. A cause which acts physically‚
must necessarily be brought into action, before any effect
can be produced by virtue of it: but a cause which acts
meritoriously, or morally, such as is the passion of Christ,
may produce its effect before it actually exists, unless it
precedeS‚ at least in his knowledge and acceptance to
whom it refers, by regard to him, to dispense the benefits
of bis grace to nien. For in this thing a 'meritorious cause
has some connexion with a final cause, which, though not
yet actually existing. but being only foreseen and pre-
viously considered, very much moves the agent in doing
this or that. In this manner we say that the passion of
Christ, and his merits depending upon it, having= been
foreseen as offered to God, and to be specially applied to
Jacob, and not to Esau, were a kind of moving cause to
God to give to Jacob that special grace which he denied to
Esau. Suares rightly says, (in 3, qu. 49, art. 4, in Comm.)

eislzer given orforeseere, God sanctifi'es and reconcz'les men to
himself, may be included in tlte merids of Christ, either by lzz's
meritinngr us tlze effect of tlzat love, or llze love (or electiore)
[ff Goclfreely bestowed upon us.

OBJEc'rnoN 4. Lastly, it may be objected‚ That it is
not consistent, or rather it is altogether incongruous‚ that
God, who willed that the death of Christ, with the rich
treasure of his merits included in it, should be equally, ap-
plicable to all rnen for the obtaining of eternal life, on con·
dition of saith, was, at the sanie time, unwilling to pre-
pare and give this saith, on account of the same merits of
Christ, equally to all3 but should give persevering and
saving saith to the elect alone, and that on account of the
merits of Christ being limited to and ordained for them by
some special will and regard of God.

REPLY. I answer, where any Divine act appears, it is
rash, I will not say impious, to doubt of its equity or con-
gruity. But we have already demonstrated, that now, by
the death of Christ, a covenant was established with the
human race, according to the tenor of which, eternal life
is promised to every nran on condition of saith. Of this
