348 A DissenTATioN oN THE DEATH OF cunrsr,

offering of Christ, namely‚ because the sacrifice of Christ
being made, he will not impute tlzeir trespasses unto them,-
that is, He will not require from any man that he should
make satisfaction for his own sins, that being impossible;
nor, further, will he punish any one for his sins who shall
make use of this propitiatory sacrifice. And lastly, it is
to be remarked, that this reconciliation, this not imputing
of sins, of which the Apostle speaks, is considered as
performed on the part of God and Christ, as soon as
Christ is understood to have laid down‘his life for the sins
of the world. But on the part of sinful men there remains
the Ministry of the Gospel, by which it is made known to
men; there remains that the Gospel should be believed,
before men are brought as it were into the actual posses-
sion of this grace. And on this account the Apostle sub·
joined, after he had said that God <in Christ reconciled the
world to himself, nevertheless it behoved Ministers to dis-
charge their embassy, and exhort all to be reconciled to
God. From all which it appears, as we submitted in our
proposition, that the death of Christ was ordained by God
and preached by the Apostles as a remedy applicable ac-
cording to the will of God, to all men for reconciliation
and salvation; although, in order that men should be ac-
tually reconciled, there is need of previous repentance aud
saith. So Aquinas understood this passage, Be με recon-

which lie said, God leam reconciled us to himself ; sor if lie
himself lmtlz reconciled, what necessity is there that we should
reconcile, sor we are already reconciled. To this ic is to be
said, that God lzatlz reconciled us ίο himself as the efficient
cause, namely, on ln's own part5 but that it may be advanta-
geous to us, it is needsul also that reconciliatz‘on should be made
on om· part. But Musculus has explained this whole pas-
sage so clearly, that we should be sorry not to bring for-
ward his words: Gocl, says he, reconciled to himself tlee
whole Ιιιιηιαη rare, which was, and is, and will hesrom tlte
beginning to ll1e end of tlze world, wlzen he gave his Son to
deatlzsor all. Then again, after a few words: God recon-
ciled the world to himself in Christ, not z'mputz'ng to them
