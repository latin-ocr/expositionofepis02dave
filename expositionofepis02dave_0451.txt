adults, in a State ofgrace, of actual reconciliatwn, or of sal-
vation, before lze believes.

Of this proposition there are two membms, which we
shall handle separately and confirm by arguments, when
we have premised a few remarks concerning the word re-
conciliatiou for the clearer understanding of the whole bu-
siness. It is to be observed then, that God being offended
at the sin of man, not only deprived him of his paternal
favour and adjudged him to eternal death3 but, moreover,
irrevocably decreed that he would on no account ever be
reconciled to us, whatsoever we might at any time either
do οι· suffer of ourselves. As the displeasure of God was
contained in these two steps as it were, so our reconcilia-
tion is accomplished by two others, answering to these, as
it were, on the opposite side. The first step of reconci-.
liation is then understood to be made, as soon as that is
done, although not by us, yet in our name, by which the
Divine will is inclined, so that he is now willing to return
into favour with us, on the performance of some certain
condition, and to bestow remissiori of sins and eternal life.
We affirm that this step to reconciliation is procured for
all men by the virtue and merit of the sufferings of Christ,
without any other medium. And hence it is (as we have
noticed above) that. the death of Christ exhibits the re-
demption or reconciliationi of the whole world: God was in
Christ reconcilz‘ng the world nuto himself, (2 Cor. v. 19.) On
which opinion Prosper says (Ad Capit. Gallor. obj. 9), lee
Recleemer fftlze world gave his bloodfor tlze world, &Q See
also Augustine's Epistles, 151, 171, 173. This reconci-
liation of the world is, therefore, as it were the first step
to the actual reconciliation of individuale, to none of whom
would an access to this Divine favour have been opened
under the condition of saith, unless it had come to pass
that God had been in some way reconciled to the human
race by the death of Christ„ The latter step to reconcilia-
tion consists in this, and is judged to be acquired by any
individual person when, the condition of saith in Christ
being performed, he is received into the paternal favour of
God, hc is justified, and is presented with an hereditary
