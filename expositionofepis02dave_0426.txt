nevertheless wish to appear to defend, not the mere suffi-
ciency of the death of Christ in itself, but that ordained
sufficienoy from the intention of God which we assert4
And for this reason, when they are pressed with arguments,
they do not refuse to make mention of the will and inten-
tion of God. Let us, therefore, examine their mind and
opinion more closely, that we may not beat the air, or
fight with a man of straw. Thus a learned man has writ-
ten on this subject (Ames, Οοιοη. p. 117), When we con ess
thot Christ deed for all, tlzat phrase Fon ΑΜ, zs admitted hy

Since the death of the Son of God did not need any'addi-

it was in itself of infinite value. Yet it needed that it
should be given for all, and accepted for their deliverance,
under some condition. Intrz'nsic sufficiency is α certain power
andfitness osa thing; (Ames, Coron. p. 99) noris there requir-
ed, in order to constitute it, the extrinsical act of one intend-
ing this sufficiency. But the ordination in behalf of certain
persons to be delivered is a voluntary act, and flows from the
intention and design of the person ordaining it. It is, there—
fore, frivolous to join the intention of God with the inter-
