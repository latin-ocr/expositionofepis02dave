are we the worse. It is, then, awretched thing to condemn
some for meat and drink's sake, or to arrogate to ourselves

What is said of circumcision‚ of meats, and of the ob-

and truly renewed and sanctified. He mentions the Scy-
thians by name, since they were accounted the most fiel-ce
of all barbarians3 as if he had said, Not even the most

barbarous barbarism should be any ground of prejudice
against those who are enlightened by saith and renewed by

the Spirit of God. Epiphaniusffi almost in the very begin-
