effectual grace and eternal life, we should be in no better
condition through Christ, than we were by Adam. But
this is opposite to the holy Scriptum, which suspends
grace and eternal life, as prepared and given through
Christ, to all who are to be saved, on the certain purpose
of the good pleasure of God, and not on the contingent
motion of the human will3 which is shewn in the contro-
versy concerning elec-tion and preterition. It is opposite
also to the opinion of the orthodox Fathers, who opposed
the Pelagians, and especially that of Augustine (de cor-
rept.&grat. cap. 11,) where, when he had shewn what

of the Divine will, through the medium of the merit of
Christ. Therefore the merit of Christ was in some special
way destined for thern by God, and is applied to them by
Christ himself.

ARGUMENT 11. That opinion is to be rejected by us
which is either altogether the same, or at least is closely
allied with the condemned opinion of the Pelagians: but
the opinion of those who assert that the death of Christ, as
to the Divine will and intention, is equally the same to all
as to its efficacy, but that it arises from the human will
that it is eventually effectual and beneficial to some, comes
as near as possible to Pelagius. But the orthodox having
been stirred up to an accurate consideration of this thing
by Pelagius, always taught, on the contrary, Thata bene—
