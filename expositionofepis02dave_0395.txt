Chap.iii. ANswmzs TO OBJECTloNs. 385

Christ, who was offered up to God for men, is now offered
tomen in the Gospel, Ι deny also that this hypothetical
and conditional oblation or giving of Christ, is even to be
thought of from this preaching of the Gospel. For the
Saviour in the place above-mentioned did not say, 8ο God
lovecl the world, that he would give his Son jor it i] it should
believe: but after that he had declared that he was given
absolutely to all from the love of God to man, he shews
nevertheless that it would not profit all to eternal life ab-
solutely and simply, but conditionally, even 311 if they
should believe, or all who should believe. We also, if at
any time we should preach the Gospel to unbelievers, as
to the Indians or Americans, should not begin to inform
them, Christ the Son of God died for some of ‘you who shall

Christ, or the death or sacrifice of Christ, was given or
promised conditionally to the human race, although salva-
tion or eternal life is every where promised to be given
under the condition of faith. Wherefore it may also be
added, That even 3 thing which is promised conditionally,
has respect in some way to those who never fulfil the con—
dition, namely, as to the right of claiming the promised
benefit, if they should fulfil it ; which Christ himself seems
to imply, Johniii. 18, where he teaches that unbelievers
are condemned, because they did not believe in the name cf
the only begotten 8οη of God. Therefore even those who
