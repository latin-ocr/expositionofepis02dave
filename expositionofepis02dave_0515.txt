thage* (apud Augustinum, Epist. 107) contends, tlmt grace
follows the will of man, (md is given to men because tlzey are
wz'lling to receive it. The remnants of the Pelagian heresy,
the Massilians,† say, (apud Prosperuni in Epist. ad Au-
gustin.)‘ Assar as it pertains to God, etet-nal life is prepared
for all,· butas far as it relales to illest-eedem of the will, it is
apprehendecl by those wlzo os their own accord believe in God,
and receive tlze help of grace through tlte merit os their be-
lieving. Pelagius himself says, (apud Augustin. de Grat·
Christi. contra Ρ. δι C. lib. l, cap. 31, p. 781) Thac men
who mulce a good use of llieirft·ee-u.=ill desert-e tlte grace of
God, but others having afim-will, by wlziclz they may come
tofailb, and merit the grace (ff God, through, making a bad
nse of thez'rfreedom‚ are destitute (ff grace and, incur damna-
tion. Faustus of Rheis says, It is of llze goodness qs God,·
that man z'S called, ic z's of lais own wil! that lze reaclily obeys.
But let us turn from the antient Pelagians and Semipela-
gianS, to those who abominate the name of pelagiane, but
are not averse from their error. ln this class I place those
Papists who teach that grace is efficacious through the
consent of the human will; so that isit should happen
that the will assented, then God would grant quickening
grace, but if it should resist, then the operation of God,
who is willing to quioken and regenerate the soul, is ren-
dered vain. Among these also l think Arminius and his
disciples are to be numbered‚ who suspend the giving or
denying of saving grace upon the will of man, so that
they say, That God does not will the conversion and rege-
neration of any one of his absolute good pleasure, but
that he wills the conversion and regeneration of all on this

condition, viz. if they should not resist his exeiting grace,

'¹‘ Vmams was a Spaniard contemporary with AugustIne‚ and considered
as the founder of the SemipelagianS. Before he fell into the errors here
attributed to him, he had been bewildered on other grounds, aud wrote his
Diocesan, Capreolus ssishop of Carthage, to know if he might say, *that
God is born of a Virgin.—Vide Du Pin, Vol. II. Cent. 5, p. 49.

-Ῑ- These were Presbyters of Marseilles originally called Massalia. Pe.
lagianism having lost its first ground, these men took refuge in the more
specious notions ot' Vitalis.—Vide Miluer, Vol. ΙΙ. p. 388.
