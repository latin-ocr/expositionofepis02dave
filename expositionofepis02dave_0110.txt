am holy, and lzave severed you from other people that με should
be mine. Being then by baptism separated and consecrated
to God, we ought to put on all virtues, and exercise perpe·
tual holiness of life.

Resides, what things are consecrated to God, are not to
be applied to any purpose, but always to be used accord-
ing to the Divine will; which is seen plain enough in tem-
ples‚ vessels, and other inanimate things ε How much
more, then, should this be attended to in men consecrated to
God by baptism? Now it clearly appears that the will of
God is our sanctjficatzbn, l Thess. iv. 3: whence Nazianzen
calls baptism, the covemmt osa more holy life with God,· and
Peter, l Epis. iii. 21, The answer osa good conscience towards
God. Inasmuch, then, as we are holy by baptism, we
ought to lead a life holy and adorned with virtues.

Wherefore that internal operation of the Holy Spirit, in
which all true Christians participate, requires the same
from them even as it were in its own right. For the opera-
tion of the Spirit brings new life; new life brings new
strength3 and these require new manners and actions.
Hence arises that exhortation of the Apostle to the rege-
nerate and sanctified, Rom. vi. 19, Now yield your members-
servants vnto righteousness unio holiness. Now, that is, since
the Holy spirit hath inspired holiness, so walk as lzoly.
Thus much of the second attribute.

And beloved] This is the third attribute, by mentioning
which he would excite the Colossians to put on and exer-
cise the virtues. Now he does not speak of the love of
the eternal benevolence, with which God embraced the elect
before the foundations of the world; for notwithstanding
this love, they are accounted among rebels and enemies to
God prior to their effectual calling and regeneration. Rom.
v· 10, and Ephes. ii. 12. He speaks, then, of the love of
friendship, by which God receives into the number of his
children the elect, when actually converted and grafted into
Christ3 as in John i. 12, But as many as received lzz‘m (Christ)
to them gave lte power to become the sons (ff God. They,
therefore, who are beloved after this manner, ought as the
beloved to put on all the virtues which are agreeable to

God3
