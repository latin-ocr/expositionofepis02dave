48 AN nxrosrrxon or s'r. PAUL'S Chap. iii.

The Apostle teaches that such a disposition of mind is
to be mortified and abandoned by a Christian man3 nor
may any Christian whatever refuse to do it;

l. Because it is Heathenish to serve his own lusts3 it
is Christian to serve God and holiness. Whenoe says the
Apostle‚ lThess. iv. 3, &o This is tlte will of God, even
your sanctific-alma that every one should know how to possess
his vessel in sanctfication and honour, not in the lust of concu-
pis-cenes, as tlze Gentiles which know not God.

2. Not only is it Heathenish, but it is brutish, to la-
bour under this disease. For it is the property of brutes
to be actuated and governed by their passions3 it is the
part of a man to restrain them, and to reduce them within
the sphere of reason. He, therefore, who is drawn aside
by every appearance of pleasure presented to his mind or
his sight, becomes lz’lce lo α horse or α mule, which laath no

Apologet. A pions and chaste man beholds a woman with sose
eyes, because his mind is blind to lust. Unless their minds
are firmly set against the allurements of sin, and strengthen-
ed by Divine grace, men become the wildest slaves of lust,
and resist not even its slightest temptations, but are led
away as captives to every vice.

Evil concupiscence] Now the Apostle endeavours to cut
up the very root of wickedness. Forsornicalion and un-
clearmess, as hath been said, denote evil acts3 ΙΙαθος, or ‹ff-
fimzinacy, that lustful and intemperate habit of mind,
whereby men are so prepared, that straightway they seize
every occasion of exercising lust, nor can restrain them-
selves3 such as the Greeks call nvaoffiavek—-(Venus-mad).
But now evil concupisceuce denotes the first motion of inor-
dinate desire‚· which is called evil to distinguish it from
