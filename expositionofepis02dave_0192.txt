Next Bernard is introduced, who in Epist. 111, thus
writes in the name of Helias the monk to his parents, who
desired to draw him home to them from the monastery,
God is tlze sole cause whereby it is not lausul to obey parents.
For he declar-m, He that lovetlzfather or mother more than me
is not worthy of me: &Q

I answer, lt is true, We must not obey parents against
the will of God: but it is false which Bernard supposes,
That children cannot serve God, unless they forsake their
parents and betake themselves into a monastery. And to
speak freely what I think, Bernard errs most grievously in
this whole Epistle, by writing as though there was no reli-
gion, no salvation‚ out of a monastery : since, on the con-
trary, every thing which really pertains to religion may be
performed by any Christian whatever without becoming a
monk3 but many things which pertain to charity, cannot
be performed by monks unless they come out from the mo-
nastery.

Bellarmin opposes to us Gregory of Τοιηεῇᾗ who com-
mends Leobardus and Pappula, because both against the
will of their parents embraced the monastic life : therefore
it is not only lawful but laudable to do this.

I answer, Gregory of Tours is not of so much authority
with us, that we should admit whatever he may have prais-
ed as commendable. We therefore oppose the 16th Chap-
ter of the Council of Gangra‚ where the same thing which

'⁵ St⁴ Gregory of Tours, as he is commonly called; otherwise George
Florence‚ aGallic Historian and Divine; born of illus-triens parentage in
Auvergne, in 544. After finishing his studies under Avitus, Bishop of
Clermont and successor to Gregory's Uncle Gallus, he was ordained a Dea-
eun, and acqouired celebrity as a preacher. In 573 he was chosen Bishop of
Tours : and discharged the duties of his episcopate with such zeal and faith-
fulness, as to be looked upon as one of the greatest ornaments of the
church of Tours. In 578 he was present at the Council of Paris, and he
was subsequently employed as an ambassador by Gontran, king of the Bur-
gundian Franks, and by his Nephew, Childebert 11„ king of Austrasia.
He made a pilgrimage to Rome in 594, and died there, or after his return
to his diocese, in 595. He wrote a History of France in ten Books, and
eight Books of the miracles and lives of the Saints; besides other works in-
serted in the ‘⁶ Bibliotheca Patrum.” Itis from his Lives of the Saints
most probably that the case adduced is bon-owed.
