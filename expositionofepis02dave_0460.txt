450 A DISSERTATION ON THE nEA'rn or cams‘r,

ver. 25, chom God bath setsorllz to be apropiliation through,
faitliin his blood, &c. Gal. ii. 16, Knowing that a man is
noejustg'fi'ed ὂιιί by {lie saith of Christ, we have believed in
Jeszts Christ that we might be justffiecl by tkefaitlz of Christ.
I omit other passages innumerable. From these it appears
abundantly, That remission of sins, and justification, or
our reconciliation with God, is not a benefit which re·-
dounds to any man from the passion of Christ himself,
without any other means ; but that those for whom Christ
died, whether sufficiently or effectually, cannot have the
saving benefit of his death applied to them, unless by faith
preceding.

Thirdly. This may also be collected from those sayings
of the Scriptures in which, the death of Christ being pre-
supposed, it is nevertheless affirmed, that some men lie
under the penalty of death, and the wrath of God, even
so long as until they apprehend the Mediator with a true
faith. To this these passages relate. Mark xvi. 16, Preaclz
tlze Gospel to every c1·eacure; lie that believetlz shall be saved,
buthe that believetli not shall be danmed. John iii. 36, He
that beli-evelli noc the Son slzoll not see lffe, but tlze wrctc'lz <ff
God abideclz on lzim. John viii. 24, Ifye believe not that I
om, με slzoll die ite your sins. Lastly, notwithstanding
Chiist died for us, the Apostle hath said, Eph. ii. 3, We
all were by nature tlze children of wiotlz ln vain, therefore,
do any dr‚eam that by the death of Chiist all men are ie-
stored to the Divine favour and a state of salvation, with-
out the intervention of any act on our part.

Fourthly. Lest any one should say that the aforesaid
testimonies relate only to the non-elect, but that all the
elect stand justified and reconciled to God by the merit of
the death of Christ, before they believe, let them hear
these plain testimonies of the Scriptures to the contrary.
Ephes. ii. ll, 12, 13, Remember tlzat με in time past were
without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealtlz (ff Israel,
and stt-angers from tlte covenants of promise, leaving 710 hope,
and without God in tlze world; but now, in Christ Jesas, γε
