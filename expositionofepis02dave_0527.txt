believers, as such, but for unbelievers, that through it
they may become believers. 'l'he application therefore,
which is not destined, but made, is understood as regard-
ing men wh0 are considered as believers3 but the applica-
tion which is destined, is understood as regarding those to
whom faith is destined to be given, by which this applica-
tion may be made. But these are the elect, and the elect
alone3 whose special prerogative it is, that according to
the absolute will of God the Father and of Christ the Me-
diator, they are decreed and caused to be infallibly saved
through the death of Christ.

These things having been premised, let us proceed to
our argument, and in the first place treat of the clear tes-
timonies of the Scriptures

l. To this purport‚ in the first place, are those pas-
sages which mention the absolute will os the Father with
respect to giving, and, as it were, commending certain
persons to the Mediator, with the design that from him and
through him they may receive all things necessary to sal-
vafflon, and at length salvation itself. (John vi. 37, 39‚)
All that the Father giveth me shall come to me, and him that
comelh to me Iwill in no wz'se cast out‚· and this is the Father's
will which laath sent me, that (gf all which he hath given me 1
should lose nothing, διο. It is evident from the context,
that not all men promiscuously, but some persons in par-
ticular, were given to the Mediator by the mercy of God
the Father, according to a certain gracious purpose of in-
fallibly and effectually bringing these persons to eternal
life. A similar passage is (John xvii. 2) Thou host given
him power over allflesh, that he should give etei-nal lg‘fe to as
many as thou hast given him. This special giving cannot
be understood to have been done otherwise than in eternal
election. But no one can justly doubt that those who
were thus given to the Redeemer‚ have a special preroga-
tive in the work of redemption. Certainly, the Apostle
has plainly signified it in Ephes. i. 4, 5, 6, &a According as
he hath chosen us in him before the foundation os the u·07lo',

Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure (ff his
