566 THE OplNlON OF ssisnor DAVENANT

PART Il.

1ῘΊ hat God, by his universal grace founded in the death os
Christ, which was safficient in itself} aad by α saitable
invitation aad calling to repentance, although in dif-

ferent ways, grants to all men individually, that they
may be saved zf they will.

The term universal grace does not sound well with
the Orthodox3 for those gifts which are bestowed upon
all nien individually (although they are given to the un-
worthy and the undeserving) are not referred to that
which is called the grace of Christ, but to the common
philanthropy of God. From whence the opinion, That
the grace qs God is universal, or is given to all indivi-
dccalty, seemed to be erroneous to Augusffine, Prosper,
Fulgentius, and the other adversaries of the Pelagians.
If, therefore, this Author means by universal grace, That
the grace of Christ is given and actually communicated
to every individual of the human race, I do not see by
what means this form of speech can be defended. For
the saving grace of Christ (if we believe the Apostles) is
communicated to individuals by the preaching of the Gos-
pel. (Mark xvi. 15, l6; Rom. i. 16; l Cor. i. 18, 21.)
From whence Prosper says, They live without grace, aad are
not partalcers (ff Christian grace, to whom Christ was never
preached. The Apostle affirms the same thing of the Ephe-
sians, before Christ was preached to them. (Eph. ii. 12.)
But if by universal grace, he means nothing more than an
universal capacity of salvation in all persons living in this
world, or an universal propensity in God to save every
man, if he should believe in Christ, he ought to correct
his language, lest by unusual, and a less sound form of
words, he should give offence to the orthodox. Further‚
this universal grace of some kind being admitted, that
which he adds, That God, through this universal grace, by
an. invitation szcitable aad seffcient in itsetf, calls all men lo
repen-lance, is refuted by the experience of time, and the
