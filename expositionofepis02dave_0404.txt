respect as to thern all, the highest and greatest that any
one can conceive. For, in the first place, when one per-
son lays down his life for many, nothing hinders that he
might not possibly love one more vehemently than another
as to the internal act: as if we should suppose that Jacob
had suffered death to deliver all his sons from captivity‚
yet we should assert rightly that he did not love them all
in the highest degree, but he loved Joseph and Benjamin
more than the others. Therefore, the highest love as to
intenseness cannot be inferred in respect of all to whom
this greatest proof of love is exhibited. Secondly, Any
one may give up his life for many promiscuously, and yet
as to the greatness of the good willed, love some much
more than others, and therefore not embrace all either with
the highest or with equal love. For the greatness of love
is not to be esteemed only by the precious thing which is
given to the person loved by the lover, but by the benefits
which are intended to be conferred upon the person loved
by that gift. For example, if a king’s son should suffer
death for all who were guilty of treason, on this condition,
that all should be absolved who were willing to humble
themselves as suppliants before the king’s throne, and faith-
fully promise obedience for the future 3 buthe should de-
sign to obtain this in addition from his father for some of
them, that on account of the merit of his death 116 would
deign to persuade them to this submission and obedience,
and having thus persuaded them, would not only absolve
them, but also advance them to the highest honours: 'who
does not perceive that death would have been endured for
all, and yet that all were not loved in the highest and
greatest degree? For since to love is to wish good things
to any one, and to confer them, it follows that in a com-
mon benefit being granted to many, those are more loved
to whom greater good things are designed and conferred
from the aforesaid benefit. Lastly, Although men cannot
exhibit to nien a greater external testimony of love than
that one should die for another, yet God the Father, Christ
the Mediator, the Godnman, and the Holy Spirit can ex-
liibit a greater sceret act aud effect of their own love to=
