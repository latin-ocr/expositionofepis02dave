Secondly, the Pelagians or Semipelagians erred in ex-
plaining the universality of the death of Christ, byjoining
with it an absurd, false, and very obscure condition. For
thus Prosper describes their opinion inan epistle to Au-
gustjne: leat our Lord λεδ-((3 Christ died sor tlte whole Ιιιι-
man race, (md that 720 one is altogether excepted from redemp-
tion by His blood, even if lte should pass all leis lg'fb in a dis·
position most alienaledfrom is. Of the same kind is that
assumption of which mention is made hythe Church of
Leyden in their book ou the three Epistles (Biblioth.
Patrum. vol. 9. part i. p. 1063), J] any persons can befound

if' tlzezs are able to prove tlzis from direct testitum-ties of tlze
Divine Scripz‘ures. The orthodox thought that a condi-
tional addition of this kind should deservedly be rejected.
For in the first place, it is uncertain what the Pelagiaus
meant by that addition. If they meant that any benefit or
advantage could be derived from the death of Christ by
those who spent all their life in impiety and unbelief, they
openly contradict the Scriptures, which do not promise
any benefit from the death of Christ to such, but threaten
them with eternal damnation on account of their contempt
of the death of Christ. Moreover, if they would intimate
that even those who die in their impiety and unbelief, if
they had believed, that is, if they had not died in their
unbelief, might have been saved by the meritos Christ
crucificd‚ through faith, they express their meaning con-
fusedly and obscurely, and what they seem to assert in
one part of the declaration, they foolishly deny in another.
Lastly, if they mean by the aforesaid assumption, that
Christ in offering up himself had considered any persons
as finally unbelieving and impenitent, and yet under this
consideration had offered up himself to the Father to ob-
tain pardon and life for them, it is evidently false and erro-
neous. For as a physician does not think of restoring
health to a sick man under this formal considerationAEven
if he should obstinately contemn and reject the medicine
which he had prepared: so neither does the Physiciau of
