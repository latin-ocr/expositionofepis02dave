Ver. 5. EPlSTLE To THE conossmns. 41

by the Latins in the Council of Lyons, Part. 2. tract 18,
quaest. 122. Alfonsus de Castro* relates the same from
Gnido, lib. 7. tit. Fornicatio. The other is the error of the
Papists‚ who stiffiy maintain that brothels are not to be re-
moved from cities: which is inferred as well from their
writings, as from their practice (for they are not attempted
to be done away).

1. They who deny that fornicationis a mortal sin, thus
argue from Acts xv. 20. The things there enumerated
seem to be placed on one footing; but fornication is there
enumerated with certain indifferent things: leey should

I answer, that fornication is not always reckoned in the
Scripture with things in their nature indifferent, but some-
times with things simply evil, as we have shewn. And the
reason why, in this place, it is enumerated with certain
things indifferent, is not, because they are of the same
nature, or of equal guilt3 but because all these things
equally prevailed to disturb the Church, and to excite dis-
sention between the Gentile conv-erts, and the Jews who

evil in itself, is understood to be so by the light of nature3
but the Heathen, who were averse to the more flagitious
crimes, as adustery, rape. and incest, thought that forni-
«cation should be imputed to no one as a vice; viz. because
nature did not point it out as a sin„

I answer‚ first, we must not decide concernz'ng things αε-
cordz‘ng to tlze opinion os tlte ungodly‚ as we must not about
tlze taste qf things according to tlte estimation {gf tlze sicle, as
Aquinas has well remarked. Therefore‚ although a corrupt
and blinded mind does not judge fornication to be sin, yet
