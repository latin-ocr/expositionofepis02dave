Ver. 20. EPisTLE To THE cotossmus. 169

In the precept three things are to be noted: To whom
it is given ; Concerning what matter3 and to what extent.
l. Clzilclren] In these words we perceive to whom this
precept is proposed. The translator has rendered it, clzil-

precept. namely, obedience to be rendered to parents.
The Greek word ὑπακόυετε, comprises two things3 a humble
promptitude in receiving the orders of another, and a
cheerful obedience in executing the same. Therefore it
pertains to this obedience, to do what parents order, to
learn what they teach, to correct and amend what they re-
