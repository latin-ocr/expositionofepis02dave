Ver. 2. EPISTLE TO THE conossmus. 225

this work seriously and with the whole strength. For the
magnitude of our intention is always wont to correspond‚
at least, it ought to correspond‚ to the magnitude of the
business which is undertaken: But now, as says Parisien-
sis, De-Rhet. divin. cap. 38, there is no business that caiz be
compared with that of obtaining pardon, grace, and glory:
but these are things which in an especial manner are songht by
prayer. Therefore, to seek such great and good things
frigid]y‚ perfunctorily‚-in a way of duty merely,—what
else is it but to mock God?

2. Because those dead and sleepy prayers, which are
uttered with a mind either wandel-ing or bennmhed, neither
reach heaven, nor can move God to hear. For our prayer
stands instead of a messenger between us and God3 but if
a messenger shall either loiter, or sleep by the way, he will·
neither reach the end of his journey, nor effect the busi-
ness entrusted to him. Hence says Cyprian, De orat.
Doni. With what effrontem dost thou require to be heard of
God, when thou dost not those-If hear the sounds of thy own
voice?

3. This intention of mind and fervour of spirit in
prayer is required, because the beart, inflamed with this
spiritual beat, immediately grows soft and is dilated, and
becomes more apt and capable for receiving the Divine
gifts. And Ι think this was the cause. that the Egyptian
Brethren should have wished to use the most brief and ra-
pid ejaculations in prayer ; namely, that their intention should
not vanish and be blunted through dela-ys, as says Augustine,
De orando Deo, ad Probam. Epist. 121. cap. 10.

4. This intention and ardor of mind is most especially
desirable even on the account, that it is a most sure sign
of a pious and devoted mind3 as, on the other hand, a cold
and sleepy prayer is a mark-of a carnal mind, and one ri-
vetted to earthly things. Thus says Chrysostom, lib. 1,
De orando Deo, When l see any one not diligent in prayer, it
is forthwith clear to me, that he can possess nothing exalted in
his mind .· again, where l behold any one eornest and very per-
severing in prayer, I conclude that he is endowed with all vir-
tue and pletis.
