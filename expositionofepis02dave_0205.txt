all their duties are disagreeable and hateful to them, at
length they are cast down in mind, they venture to try or
attempt nothing, but they become inactive and torpid.
And parents should especially beware not to sink their
children to this: for children are as the hands and arms
with which the old age of parents should be defended3
they are the feet and legs whereby they must be sustained.
Therefore as any one would deservedly be accounted mad,
who should occasion such numbness to his legs and arms
by any narcotic medicament‚ that they might become in a
manner useless to him : so are those parents to be account-
ed not far from insane, who by , their severity and cruelty,
so beat and render their children stupid‚ that they can
neither be of any help to their parents nor themselves.

3. This discouragement brings in its train (especially in
those who are not of a very good disposition) a certain
desperate contumacy. For when they perceive that· all
hope of pleasing is done away, they also on the other hand
cast off all hope of pleasing3 yea, sometimes assume to
themselves a boldness in displeasing, and a wantonness of
provoking their parents. This, indeed, is the height of
impiety in a child3 but yet the father must beware not to
occasion this impiety by his cruelty. For repeated cruelty
does not whet the minds of children to perform their duties,
but recals and withdraws them from it. And thus much
of the duty of parents.
