tites and their proneness to sin. To these are allied innu-
merable inferior members, and which, as it were, depend
upon them, some of these are soon after subjoined in this
place, and more occur in Galat. v, 19—21, where, the
name being changed, they are called works (ff thefleslz.

Now let us see why they are termed members. It is usual
to adduce three causes for this title.

Fir-st, because the old Adam, oi· the mass of corrupt
nature dwelling in us, is compared to a body, Rom. vi. 6,
or to a mam, in the same place3 therefore it was just and
proper, this same metaphor being retained, to call the parts
of this corruption members. Every one of us possesses
three rnen, or three bodies ε the natural and visible body,
the members of which are also known and visible; the
body of sin, or of the old Adam, the members of which
are those vicious dispositions, desires, and actions which
wejust now glanced at: and the body of the new mam
which is renewed after the image of God 3 the members of
which are saith, love, holiness, and other gifts of the Holy
Spirit.

2. The vicious affections and acts proceeding from this
old Adam are perhaps called members, because they cleave
' to and exert themselves in each of the members and parts
of this natural body. Therefore, by that figure of speech
which they call metonymy (gf tlte subject, the term members
is transferred to signify the vicious affections and acts
which are in and from the bodily members.

3. They are called members from the proportion‚ or si-
milar use which they have, if compared with the members
of the natural body. For as we use the members of this
natural body to fulfil the desires and perform the opera-
tions of nature3 so the old man uses those vicious affec--
tions as instrumente, for fulfillin'g the desires and perform-
ing the works of sin.

Ye perceive why they are called members: now let us
look why your and eartlzly is added.

Yomu] These members are called ours, because that
whole body of sin is also properly ours. This natural body
which we bear, is ours now as to its use3 but we received
