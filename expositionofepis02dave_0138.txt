128 ΑΝ EXPOSlTloN or ST. PAUL'S Chap. iii.

2. However they, who are the cause and the heads of
factions and dissentions, flatter themselves, and seem to
themselves to be lords‚ they are of all men the most mi-
serable, because they are most hateful to God. T lzese sia:
things dotlz tlte Lord hate, yea, seven are an abomination to
him, Prov. vi. 16. Now Solomon puts in the seventh
place, lze wlco soweth discord among bretlzren‚ vers. 19.

3. He who violates peace, is not only hurtful to others,
but to himself. For no member of an’ uniform body is in-
jured, but it occasions detriment to the whole : Since there-
fore, we are all members of the same body, he who tears
and injures another, does the same as if any one by his
own hand should beat and wound another member of his
own body.

4· They who are pleased at the discords and evils of

the Apostle exhorts‚ namely, gratitude3 which Cicero

tude is required as well in regard to God, as in regard to
men.

We ought to be thankful to God3 because without
gratitude there can be no spiritual blessings within us.
For since every spiritual blessing depends upon a cer-
tain perpetual influx of Divine grace, ingratitude is that
infernal bar which interrupts the fiow and the course of the
Divine goodness. Therefore we ought to be thankful, lest
we should be deprived of all our gifts. But gratitudo to
God is joined with peace in this place, because our grati-
tude towards him especially appears in this, if we cultivate
peace religiously3 ingratitude, if we violate it. For as a
mendicant and vagrant taken into a royal family, shews
himself grateful, if he endeavours with all his might to
adom and defend the royal house3 but on the contrary,
proves himself ungrateful, if he ainis to fill the same with
eumities, and to rond it asundcr by factiuns: so miserable
