resisted and mortified more and more : Well spake Origen,
in Epist. ad Romanos ε lee mortffication of sin is not effected
ina moment, buc z's the worlc of an unceasing struggle. Sin
languislzesfivm tlte commem-emeat of ourmortg'fi'catz'ou, it wastes
away in the progress, at last (i. e. in our death) it shall be
abolt'shed. Lastly, it is not unseasonably answered, that
the dead are commanded still to mortify themselves, be-
cause if they neglect the constant practice of mortifica-
tion, vices that were trodden under‘and subdued recover

3. Your members which are upon tlze earth] He passes
from the act to the object about which this practical morti-
fication ought to be exercised. Let us, therefore, in the
third place, consider this object; and since every word
here used by the Apostle hath great meaning in itself‚ we
shall examine each singly.

Members] As to this first word we must point out two
things: First, what the Apostle intended by members ‚· Se-
condly‚ what is the reason of this epithet. He calls, then,
all vicious and inordinate dispositions‚ desires, motions,
and acts of corrupt nature, members: for all these are to
be mortified by us, i. e. opposed, subdued, repressed. The
primary members of this our corrupt nature are three: the
darkness and vanity of the intellect3 the depravity and
obliquity of the wi113 the rebellion of the inferior appe-
