476 A DlSSER'l'ATmN ΟΝ THE DEATH OF CHRlST·

(De vera Grat. Chr. p. 68) sayS, Arminius here commits usal-¹
lacy, in promising to him tlzat hath in α state ofnature, a giltjbr
salvation in a state (ff grace, and makes the light of saith the
reward (ff diligence in‘unbelievers. For in whatever thing,
and of whatever kind, good use is made, in the same thing he
also promises increase. Alvarez, a Papist, informs us on
this subject (De Auxil. disp. 56, p. 651), No law was ever
made for giving the helps of grace to those who do all that is in
their powerfrom thefacallis of nature, neither did Cla-ist the
Lord by his death merit, or desire to merit, such a law. The
Apostle Pau] teaches that the dispensation of supernatural
grace proceeds, not according to the use and works of the
will of man, but according to the purpose and counsel of
the will of God ε He worheth all things according to the par-
pose and comzsel of his own will (Eph. i, ll.)

Secondly, although we acknowledge that some sparks of
natural light remain in heathens‚ and some imperfect desire
of moral good, yet, as the same ssishop of Salisbury whom
we have before commended, excellently says, (pp. 66, 67)
Because those deformed ruins have no inhabitant bat the devil,
there cannot be any other than α corrupt use, in the midst of
the corruption osthese remains. Let the adversaries shew to
us even one man from the beginning of the world, who
from the good use of nature derived to himself the gift of
grace. It is impossible (morally speaking) that a heathen in
a state of corrupt nature, should not place very many ob-
stacles to Divine grace, so far is he from well using his natural
powers, so that he may obtain for himself gratuitous and
supernatural aid. Aquinas truly says, (Contr. Gent. lib.
3, p. 160) If lhroztgh preceding disordersree-will should de-
cline to evil, it will not be at all in his power to offer no impe-
diment to grace. Therefore, they who think that Evange-
lical grace is given to all those who make a right use of
the light of nature, and do not oppose an impediment to
grace, dream that there are such men in a state of corrupt
nature, as it is not oredible there ever were, or are, or will
be. For whatever may be called an impediment, no one can
remove this impedimenc bnt God, as Bradwardine truly
