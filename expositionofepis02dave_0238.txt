Faith then will not immediately draw back, but abide as it
were in hope, and wait until it shall seem good to God to
grant its request.

Instructions regarding the intention arising from these
considerations.

1. Whereas we are excited by the Apostle to intensity
and fervour of mind in prayer, we must conclude, that we
are by nature frigid and torpid in this exercise‚ so that we
can scarcely abstain from sleep unless we have a monitor
and one to arouse us. The drowsiness of Apostles them-
selves testifies this, Matt. xxvi. 40.

2. We must therefore beseech God to impart to us the
Spin-it of prayer: for fiesh and blood neither knows nor
can understand the true and just ground of prayer without
the teaching and inspiration of the Spirit. Hence that
declaration in Rom. viii. 2, We know not what toprayfor as
we ought, &Q ’

3. Hence we clearly deduce, that the prayers of those
persons are of none, or of little moment, who by no sense,
no understanding· of those things which are uttered, mut-
ter forth their daily prayers‚ that they may be only said
thereby to have prayed. But they might have learnt even
from this place, that prayer is not a mere matter of duty,
buta serious and laborious concern, in which it behoves
us to 'oe instant, not to sleep.

The PapistS‚ therefore, deserve every odium, who would
have a Christian people to hear public prayers in ran un-
known tongue, and also to babble their private prayers in
an unknown tongue 3 as though they only desired to ren—
dera most divine and usesul thing ridiculous, unfruitful,
and becoming parrots more than men. We shall briefly
glauce at this error.

Itis clear, that there is required in serious prayer both
a consideration of those things which we ask of God, and
an ardent desire of the sanie. Cyprian, De orat. Domin.
thus writes concerning consideration, Let every carnal
thought be banislzed; neither let the mind tlzz'nlc (inprayer) <ff
any thing else than that alouefor which· it is p7·ayi21g. Con-
