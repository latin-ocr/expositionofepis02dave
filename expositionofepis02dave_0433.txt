Clzap. iv. THE saecun PRoPoslTloN srATsso, διο. 423

But I must premise‚ in order to verify this form of
speech, that it is not necessary, either from the sense of
the Scriptures, or from that of the Fathers, or from the
meaning of the words themselves, that we should defend
the opinion, that all those for whom it is affirmed that
Christ was crucified and died, are to be led by the infal-
lible order of predestination to eternal life through the
benefit of the death of Christ3 although we willingly
acknowledge that the intention of Christ in dying was,
that some might be saved, which, in its proper place, we
shall confirm by testimonies of the Scflptures, and by per-
spicuous arguments.

First, then, in Scripture language, these two things are
not always equivalent, Christ diedfor these persons, and,
God predestinated that through the deasle cys Christ tlzese per-
sons should be z'tffallibly saved; because the Scriptures often
decl-are universally, that Christ died for all, but never af-
firm universally‚ that God predestinated that all ⁸men
should be saved through the benefit of the death of Christ.
For what purpose, Ι ask, is it that the Spirit of God, in
speaking of the death of Christ, frequently makes use of ge-
neral terms‚ extending it to all,while in mentioning theDivine
predestination, he always uses restrictive tei-ms, limiting it
to few, if the death of Christ, and the predestination of
God as to mankind, had an equal and altogether the same
extent?

Secondly, Because in the sacred Scriptures Christ is
said in the same sense to have reconciled men, to lzave given
himself as α ransomjor men, to have diedfor men, and he is
said also to have reconciled and redeemed the world, inas-
much as the world has in his death an ordained and esta-
blished universal cause, which, being apprehended by
saith by any human being w-hatsoever, he may be actually
reconciled to God and delivered from the guilt of his sins:
therefore also, he is rightly conceived to have died for all,
inasmuch as all men through his death have eternal life set
before thern, to be procured by saith. As, therefore, when
God is said to have reconciled che world in Christ, or Christ
is said to have given himself α ransomfor all, it is not said,
