to all men3 which is evidently false. Therefore some spe-
cial giving must necessarily be admitted, according to
which Christ may be understood to be given for the elect
alone, and which alone brings with it an infallible and
certain giving of all things necessary to salvation.

Tsssv. 7. Stapleton‚ (Promptuar. moral. Dominio. 2,
post. Pasch. p. 254) observes, Christ in clying died effec-
tually indeedfor lzls friends alone, ancl for those wlzo would
become his friends after the conversz‘on of each of them, notfor
those wlzo were hisfriencls before. This Papist does not fear
to acknowledge a special intention of Christ in dying as
to the elect. For these vvere to be his friends after their

here intimates two things 3first‚ That the oblation of Christ
had a general regard to all men, but a special one to the
elect3 secondly‚ That the special regard ought to consist
in this, that it should be joined with a certain intention of
applying it. For he does not say, The elect alone apply
this death of Christ to themselves for salvation through the
strength of their free-will; but, Itis applied to these alone
for salvation3 truly, by the special favour of God in choos-
ing them and intending this great benefit for his elect
through the death of Christ.

defend universal grace and universal redemption, yet dare
not deny the special and effectual appointrnent and inten-
