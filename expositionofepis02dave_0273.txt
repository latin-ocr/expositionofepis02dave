Ver. 6. Episrilss το την, COLOSSlANs. 263

Thac με may know] Tremellius translates it, And lcnow
ye. In which words the Apostle shews the very cause
or fountain of sound speech, namely, the knowledge
drawn ‘from the word of God, laid up in the mind of the
speaker. For sound speech does not produce our know-
ledge3 but knowledge causes us to use sound speech.
Therefore, although in the order of nature knowledge pre—

afflicted, and those gronniug under the burden ofa wound-
ed conscience3 in a word, that to all, desiring our discourse
on any account whatever, we may speak wisely and with
profit.
