Ver. 6. EPJSTLE To THE conossmus. 55

The unger (ff God is not the perturbatiora of an eoecited mind,
(mc the tranquil constitution of riglzteousjudgment. And in
Euchirid ad Laurent. cap. 33, When God is said to be angry,
perturbationis not szgnijz'ed, lilce wlzac z's in tlte mind of an
angry mun ; but leis veregeance takes tlze name of anger from
human motions. Ambrose in Psalm xxxvii. God does not lie
open to passion, so that lte should be angry ‚· since he is with-
out passions; bnt because lle avenges Ῐιε seems to be ‹mgr-y.
This seems so to us, because we are accustomecl to avenge our-
selues with commotiore. The Schoolmen speak the same, but
more compendiously: Anger is attributed to God, not ac-
cording to tlte passion (ff inquietude, but according· to tlze
‹fficcof vengeunce. From this common opinion of theolo-
gians, Tertullian in 1 contra Marcion, and Lactantius in
lib. De ira Dei, cap. 5, and 16, seem to differ: whose '
opinion is either to be sostened down by a suitable inter-
pretation, or rejected.

We may therefore assume, that by the wratlz of God ven-
geance is to be understood, or the punishment imposed
upon sinners; and it will be easy to shew that this wrath
of God isjoined and connected with sin, and especially
the sins of luxury. In Gen. vi. ll, we read, The earth was
corrupt and filled with violence. Here is the sin! But di-
reetly it follows, ver. 17, Ι will bring aflood of waters upon
the earth and destroy ollflesh. Behold the wrath or ven-
geance! So in Gen. xviii. 20, The cry os Sodom and Go-
‘mo-rrlza is great, and their sin is very grievous. Here you
have the sin. Gen. xix. 24, leen the Lord ruined upon So-
dom and Gomorralz brimstone andfire. Here you have the
vengeance. It would be tedious to go through all the ex-
amples of sacred Scripture. Let that in Job xxxi. 3, suf-
fice: Is not destruction to tlte wiclced, und a strange punish-
ment to the worlcers (ff iniquity? as though he had said, It
is certain, and placed beyond doubt, that God is estranged
from sinners, and provoked to destroy them.

Seldom laath. punishment, though bulting in. ils pace, sailed
-to overtulce the wiclcecl strivz'ng to lceep lzeacl of it?³ss Nay, it
