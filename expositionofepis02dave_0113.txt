Ver. 12. EPISTLE To THE comssmns. 103

of putting on ε It follows that we notice the virtues them—
selves to be put on.

L‘owels (ff mercies, lcincluess, humbleness of mind, meelmess,
long-suffering] He begins with those duties which we owe
when in prosperity to our neighbours in adversity. And,
in the first place, the Apostle requires us to put on bowels
of mercies, that is, the real inward and unpretended affec-
tion of condoling with another's woe. The phrase is a
Hebraism, which the Apostle frequently uses, even in the
New Testament. And it is taken from the emotion‚ and,
as it were, concussion which is felt in the stomach, in deep
. affections of the mind. Thus it is said of Joseph, Gen.
xliii. 30, llis howels didyearn, or vvere set on fire towards his
brother. So in Lamentations ii. ll, Illy bowels are troubled,
my liver is pozcred on the eartlzsor {he destruction oftlce daugh-
ter of my people. In the New Testament also the same
phrase is used: See Luke i. 783 Phil. ii. 1. The most
tender affection is, therefore, intended by the expression
howels of ‹met-cies. The Apostle wisely begins with the ex-
pression of condolence3 because from hence flows the act
of relief3 and because, as says Gregory, Mor. 20. 27, It is
more to compassz‘onatc att-y one from tlze lzeart, tlzcm to give:
for he who gz‘ves what is extet-nal, gives what does not belong to lais
own person ; but lte wlco gives compassion, gives somewlzat of
himself.

The chief objects of this compassion are persons who
have none to give them relies, as widows and orphans3 but,
in general, it comprehends all oppressed with nfisery,
whether the poor, prisoners, the sick, the afflicted, &Q

We have many motives or incentives to this affection of
mercy.

l. We have the express and oft repeated command of
God : Luke vi. 36, Beye mercfful: Rom. xii. 15, Weep with
them tlzat weep; and l Pet. iii. 8, Be [με lcindly offectioned,

lzast nothing, give buc a tem-‚- sor pity is α great soloce to the
afflicted.

2. We have, besides, the examples of the prophets, of
Christ, and the Apostles, aud, lasffly, of all good men:
