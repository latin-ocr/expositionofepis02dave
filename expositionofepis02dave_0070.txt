in saying wlzen με lived in them, yse then walkecl in sins,
would intimate, Ye now live no longer in them3 therefore,
ye ought not to walk any longer in them. Thus ye have
the force of the argument. Now let us consider the
words.

In the which] Erasmus renders it, among whom, and
refers it to the children of disobedience: but Beza better, in
which, viz. the aforesaid vices, sor wlzich tlze wratli of God
cometh on tlze children of dz'sohedc'ence.

Ye also walked] They are said to walls in sins, who con-

to sin3 which is implied hythe contrast.

From the consideration of their former state, these in-
structions arise.

l. Nothing is more unhappy than unrenewed menz For
to walk in sin with pleasure, is to hasten towards hell with
pleasure: lee weges of εἰη z's death, Rom. vi. 23.

2. ‚The fruits of a man in a corrupt state, are not works
preparatory lo grace, or, deserving lise eternal, of congruitas,
as the Schoolmen say3 but they are preparatory to hell, and
meritoriousof εἰει-Ναί death, from condignily: for he walks
