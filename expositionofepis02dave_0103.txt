Ver. ll. Epis‘rtss To THE conossiANs. 93

ning of his first book against the eighty heresies, calls
barbarism Scythism3 and says, that barbarism flourished
in the ten first generations of the world, afterwards that
Scythism prevailed from the flood to the destruction of the
tower of Babel. But I confess that I do not clearly under-
stand the reason of this distincti0n3 that the Scythians
are so joined to the Barbarians, I think is for the sake of
amplffication, and not of distinction: which also seemed
the case to Ambrose, who writes that the Scythians are
distinguished from other Barbarians in this place because
they surpassed the rest in rudeness of manners.

No pious and holy man is to be esteemed nothing worth,
because he is of unpolished manners and destitute of lite-
rary attainments. It is not elegance of manners but inno-
cence of life, not erudition but faith‚ which commende us ⁴
to God. Ye see your calling, bretlzren, lzow that not many
wisc men cy‘cer tlzefleslz‚ not many mighty, not many noble are
called. But God bath chosen the foolislz things (ff tlze τυόνΙᾱ

of other things is no hindrance to one who knows Christ,

and beconiing an ascetic‚ returned to Palestine, and adopted this discipline
of Hilarion, the founder of Monachism in that country. Epiphanius
erected a Monastery near the place of his birth, over which he presided till
he was elected to the See of Salamis, in 367. In 391 he commenced a con-
troversy with John Bishop of Jerusalem, relative to the opinions of Origen,
which Epiphanius condemned. In the course of this dispute, as in others
in which he was involved, he displayed more zeal than charity or prudence ;
particularly when in the height of his resentment against the favourers of
Origen, he sent word to the Empress Eudoxia‚ who requested his prayers
for her son Theodosius, who was ill, that the prince should not die, provided
she would discard the heretics who ‘enjoyed the imperial patronage. Epi-
phanius died in 402 or 403, on returning from Constantinople to Cyprus.
He wasa man of great learning, but deficient in judgment and accuracy.
His work entitled “ Panarion,'’ against heresies, is reckoned as a piece of
Ecclesiastical history ς but the carelessness or ignorance of the author as to
facts and opinions, deducta much from its authority. The best edition of
the writings of Epiphanius is that of I'ctavius‚ Paris, 2 vols. soli03 reprint-
cd at Colognc, in Milz-Gomon.
