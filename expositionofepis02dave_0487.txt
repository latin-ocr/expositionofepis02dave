teaches (De causa Dei, contra. Pelag. lib. 2, cap. 32³t).
Tlfirdly, and lastly, we assert, on the testimony of the
holy Scripture and of experience, that the Gospel and
other means of salvation‚ were not granted or denied to
men for this reason, because some made a right use of the
light of nature, or at least made a less evil use of it, and
others perversely and wickedly abused it. For it appears
from the sacred Scriptures, that the light of the Gospel
shone on those thoughtless persons who in the worst
manner abused their natural light or talent. Such were
the Romans, Corinthiam, (l Cor. vi. ll) Ephesians, (Eph.

ii. 8, 21) among whom the torch of the Gospel was lighted
up by the Apostles, when they vvere voluntarily living in

'⁵ BRADWAnmNE (Thomas) a learned English Divine of the l4th Cen-
tury. He was born at Hartfield, in Sussex, and educated at Merton Col-
lege‚ Oxford, where he took the degree of D.D. and became Proctpr and
Divinity Professor of the University‚ and after being appointed Chaneellor
of the Diocese of London, attended Edward ΙΙΙ. as his Confessor during
his wars in France. Whilst so situated, a vacancy occurred in the See of
Canterbury, and the Monks elected him Archbishop3 but Edward, who was
fond of his company, refused to part with him. Another vacancy happen-
ing soon after, the Monks elected him a second time, and Edward yielded
to their desires, and Bradwardine was consecrated Archbishop in 1349 ; but
he died 40 days after his consecration at Lambeth, and was buried at Can-
terbury. He excelled in Mathematical knowledge, and wrote several trea-
tises on that science which have been published; among them is one on the
quadrature of the circle. He was most distinguished, however, for his ac-
curate and solid investigations in Divinity ; and is best known as the author
of a book against Pelagianism, entitled Dc Causa Dei. 'l'he render unac-
quainted with it, but desimus of knowing something of the contents of a
thick and closely printed Latin folio, or of the nature of a work as profound
in argument as it is elaborate in illustration, may consult Milner, who, in
Vol. IV. of his Church History, has given a good account of it. The ori-
ginal itself is well worthy of examination, if it were only to convince some
of the would-be-thought theologians of our time, that humility and reserve
would become them better than a ‘jejune expression of opinions on subjects
which have so occupied men of gigantic minds3 and to display to others the
deep piety and ardent devotion which existed with solid learning, extensive
acquirements, and alofty genius. The fame of this work, it is said, led
Chaucer, in his “ Nuns’ I'riests' tale‚’' to rank Bradwardine with St. Au-
gustine, Bishop of Hippo. An Apologue in this treatise appears to have
furnished Parnell with the story of his beautiful l'oem ‘⁶ The Hermit.'’-—
'l'he best Edition is that by Sir Henry Saville, printed at London, in 1613.
