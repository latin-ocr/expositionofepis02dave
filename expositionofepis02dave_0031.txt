are they whom we had sometime in derision aad a proverb (ff
reproach. We fools accounted their life madness, and their end
to be without honour. How are they numbered among the chil-
dren of God, and their lot is among the saints!

Secondly‚ as to the saints and faithful themselves, their
spiritual life is hid; but partly, not entirely. Ι say it is
in some measure hid, because they themselves do not
always clearly perceive the life of grace in them 3 but some-
times, being assaulted by the temptations of the devil and
the flesh, they are half in doubt that they themselves are
indeed slain, and destitute of the Spirit of God. Hence
that word of the Psalmist li. 10, Create in me a clean heart,
Ο God‚· and renew a right spirit within me. Moreover, when
they perceive in themselves this spiritual life, they never·
theless acknowledge it to be very weak, languid, and ob· ⁴
scure on account of that perpetual resistance and rebellion
of the flesh. So Paul felt that he delighted in the law (ff
God aster the z'nner inan,- Here we see his spiritual lise ! yet
the same Paul sees another law in his members warring against
the law of his mind; Here we see the same life hidden and
obscured ἔ Rom. vii. 22, 23.

Now as to the life of future glory, that is much more
hidden: For although we have the seeds of this life within
us, yet they are trodden down under this mortal body, nei-
ther are they brought into full light before the day of
Christ's coming. In the meanwhile, as it is in l John iii.
2, We are now the children of God, hut it dotlz not yet appear
what we shall be: nay, we are not indeed able to take in
even in imagination this hidden life, 1 Cor. ii. 9.

With Christ in God.] This also fitly accords both to the
spiritual life to which we are now raised, as well as to that
glorious life to which we are to be raised3 for each is hid-
den iu Christ, as in the fountain, the root, or original.
But these words in God, are added, because Christ himself,
as man, hath withdrawn himself from the earth, and as-
cended to God the Father. Therefore, God is invisible
and hidden from the world, and Christ with God, and our
life with Christ. As to spiritual life, it is certain that
whatever small streams are derived to us, the sountain itself
