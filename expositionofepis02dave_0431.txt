men individually is asserted. For it does not follow from
the declaration, That God by the death of Christ con-
firmed a covenant concerning the salvation of all the elect
through faith3 Therefore, If Cain should believe, he shall
be saved. The conditional covenant, therefore, is esta-
blished with the whole human race. Thirdly, We prove
that this evangelicalcovenant, confirmed by the death of
Christ, concerning the giving of salvation on the condi-
tion of faith, is universal, by urging further this same ar-
gument, and that from the concessions of those who seem
to be opposed to us. Those who endeavour to restrict the
death of Christ as much as possible, nevertheless grant,
that by the merit of his death, there is a way ancl metlzod
appointed, by which any unbeliever may escapedeserved con-
demnation, namely, if he should believe. (Collat. Hag. ps
154). They grant, that the death of Christ would abundantly
suffice to save all men, how many soever they may bein the whole
world who believe in him· They allow also, Thac the word
of the Gospel concerning Christ crucffied, should be annozmced
indiscrimz‘nately to the elect and nou-elect, and all should be
commanded to believe in him, thz's promise being added, that all
who believe in him shall obtain remissiori of sins. (Acta.
Synod. Dord. p. 29, and 2 part, p. 89). These things being
granted, Ι argue thus: If mankind, howsoever many they
be in the whole world, would obtain remission of sins and
salvation, if they should believe3 then an universal cove-
nant was established by the death of Christ concerning the
salvation of any man whatsoever under the aforesaid con-
dition of faith. But the first is true: Therefore also the
second. The reason of the consequence is this, Because
that conditional declaration, which they admit both as to
the non-elect, and the elect, namely, [f thou shall believe,
whosoever thou art, thou shalt be saved, is not as neces-
sarily true from the nature of the thing, as this is, Ifthere
zkfire, there is heac, or, [f he is a man, he is an animal ; it
remains, then, that its truth be founded in some voluntary
ordination of God, by which he hath decreed, as to any
human being whatsoever, that the antecedent being true of
him, the consequence is so likewise. Since no third foun-
