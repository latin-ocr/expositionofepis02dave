wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of leion the esses ff
your understandz'ng' being enlightenesl, &Q The Apostle uses
the word agnition rather than cognition, lest any one should
think⁶he spoke of some idle and speculative knowledge3
whereas the former word always means with him a lively,
efficacioris, and operative knowledge. This enlightening,
then, of the understanding. and infusion of saith, and spi-
