tion of this saving passion as to the elect. Let two ofthe
most eminent, Suares and Vasques,* speak for the rest.
Suares (in3 Aquin. qu. 19, disp. p. 635, 41) remarks, As
Christ prayedfor men in α different manner ; so he merited in
α dfflrent manner, for some suffieiently, for others effectualiy.
On which account, although he is the universal Redeemer of
all, and a stgfficient cause of salvation, yet he is in a special
way the effectaal cause of salvation to those whom he makes
obedient to himself. For it cannot be supposed, that Christ
did not otherwise offin- his met-its for those whom he knew to be
elected by the Father‚ thanfor others, when he saw that it zoas
the wilt of the Father that these should be infallibly saved, and
not the others, Suares here allows, that the death and me-
rits of Christ are effectual to the salvation of the elect on
account of the special mode of the oblation, and the will
of the Offerer3 not on account of the causal or contingent
act of the human will in apprehending it.

3, p. 687) clearly acknowledges this special intention of
Christ as to the elect in the application of his merits. I
doubt not that Christ by his peculim· prayer and will applied
his met-its to those who were predestinated and elected. Agaffl,
(in 3 Aquin. qu. 19, disp. 77, cap. 5, p. 384) he produces
Andreas Vegas† asserting, That the ‘mer-its of (Ihrist did not
profit alt men effictually, because Christ dict not pra-y, not·
offer his passion for those whom they do not profit. We have
