their sins, and placed in a state of salvation without any
act of their own will. For as they cannot by faith apply
the blood of Christ to cleanse their souls, the God of
mercy, by the secret operation of his own spirit, as it
were, sprinkles and quickens their souls by the blood of
Christ. This is well observed by Aquinas (Quaest. disp.
de Justific. art. 3,) Because children, says he, have no means
whereby they can turn themselves to the justififing cause, the
jastifising cause itself, namely, the passion os Christ, is ap-
plied to them in baptism, and bis this they are jastffied.

The last thing is, By the state of grace and salvation-
When we deny, that it is attained by any adult before he
apprehends the Mediator by the act of saith, we mean that
state which the Psalmist has described (Ps. xxxii.) when
he says, Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose ,
sin is covered; the same as the Apostle describes (Coloss. i.
13, 14) where he says, that they were delivered frmn the
power of darkness, and translated into the kingdom of God's

It is necessary to prove this proposition thus explained,
both against those who assert, that by the merit of the pas·
sion of Christ all men are received into a state of grace
and salvation, and against those who think that the elect
at least were from eternity reconciled, justified, and had
their sins pardoned. Some attribute the first opinion to
the Remonstrants 3 but, as it appears to me, although they
speak ambiguously and obscurely, they are free from this
error. Some persons say (Colloq. Hagiens. p. 9) That
Christ hy his death upon the cross meritedjor all men reconci-
liation and remissiore of sins. But they add, yet so, that noue
are really parlalcerscff this remissiori, except those who believe.
Thus they say elsewhere (p. 131,) That Christ by the death
of the cross obtained for all men reconciliation and remissiones
sins. But they immediately add this gloss, That the real
participation of this obtained reconcz'liatz'on and remissiori is pe·
caliar to those that believe. And in pp. 162, 163, they ex-
pressly reject that opinion which is attributed to them by
some persons, namely, That all men are by the death cf
