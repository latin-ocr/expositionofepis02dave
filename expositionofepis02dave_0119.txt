world, as well as to shake off spiritual lethargy. Besides,
they shew forth the virtues of the pious and the glory of
God, and augment the reward and crown promised to the
saints: In one word, they always work togetherfor good to
them wlio love God, Rom. viii. 28.

3. On account of our consciousness of sin and demerit.
For whatever evils are brought upon us by the malice of
men, are permitted by thejustice of God. He would in-
flict far heavier if he treated us according to our deserts.
So the godly have ever acknowledged3 Nehem. ix. 333
Dan. ix. 8.

4. On account of the worth and excellence of affliction.

For it is not reproach (as the vulgar think) to suffer for
Christ, or be trampled upon by the wicked3but, on the
contrary, honourable. Whencc says Peter, l Epis. iv. 16, '

him, bat also ίο suff'erfor his salse.

From what has been said of these two virtues we gamer,

That they are not to bc accounted happy nor men of for·
titude, who in this world commit violence and oppress
others, and do what they please against whom they ple-ase
under the impulse of their fury aud lust. They are not
happy3 since this is both the signal and the cause of their
future damnation‚ Phi. i. 28: nor men of fortitude; for
this is the effect of the old and impotent Adam, and shews
them to be destitute of the sanctifying Spirit and all its
gifts and ornaments.

On the other hand, We infer from the foregoing3 that
they· who bear with a meek spirit the inj uries and reproaches
of the wicked, are neither base nor miserable3 but happy
