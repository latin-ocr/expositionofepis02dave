290 ΑΝ EXPOSiTmN or ST. PAUL'S Chap.iv‚

Hence let us observe,

1. The especial duties of a minister3 namely, to teach his
flock, and to pray for it: For prayers arethe weapons oftsze
priest, as Ambrose lieretofore remarked. We will give our-
selues to prayer, and to the ministris of tlte word, Acts vi. 4.

2. The duty lies upon the minister, not only of praying
publicly for the people committed to him, but privately,
and that even mostly as often as he shall happen to be ab·
sent from his flock; this we are taught· by this example of
Epaphras. Thus much concerning the effect itself, namely
prayer: Now concerning the mode.

2. A lways labow-ingfervenllzs.] In these words he shews
of what kind was this prayer of Epaphras for the Colos-
sians 3 namely, constant, and also fervent. That word
always, παντοτε, indicates the constancy: as though Paul
had said, that the distance of place had not induced for·
getfulness of his flock in the mind of Epaphras3 but that
he, though then dwelling at Rome, was no less mindful of
them in his daily prayers, than when present with them he
looked on them personally. But that word [αὐοιινὶηὲΓ fer-
vently, αγωνιζομενος, which intimates a contest, and as it were
a wrestling with God himself, shews earnestness and fer-
vor. For as Jacob of old wrestlinq with God would not
let him go, without the blessing sought from him3 so this
godly minister strove daily with God, and urged him in a
manner more vehemently to bless the Colossians.

Hence observe, it is the duty of a pious minister, not
out of form or custom, but from real inward love, to pray
God for the welfare of his flock. But of this we have
spoken in the second verse.

3. 'I'lzat με rmay stand peffect and complele in all the will
(ff God.] This is the matter, or sum of the prayer: and
here he desires for thern three chief blessings; a true and
perfect knowledge of the Divine will, true and perfect obe-
dience to it, and final perseverance in each: for this is the
meaning of the phrase ινα στῆτε, thatye may stand. As to
the two former3 both are implied and contained in that
petition, that ose vmay Slandpeifecc and complele in all tlte will
of Gocl. For no one is perfect and complete in all the will.
