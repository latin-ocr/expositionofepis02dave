112 AN Exposl'rloN OF ST. PAUL's Cleap. iii.

not avenge them, or because they do not think it expedi-
ent3 yet in the mean time the injury is treasured up in their
memory, malicie rages in their hearts, and a thirst for re-
venge burns. The Apostle, therefore, would have us, not
only bear an injury, but remove from our hearts the very
desire itself of revenge3 nay, that we should cherish a love
for ourmost bitter enemies. Here applies the precept of
Christ, Matt. xviii. 35, leat every otteforgive lzis brolher
from lzis hem-t.- and Luke vi. 27, 28, Loveyour enemies,· do
good to them that lzate you ; bless them, τΙιαί czcrseyou, and
prcryfm· them that despitffitl& use-you. We read that all
this was religiously observed by Christians in the primitive
Church. It is tlze cuslom ofall to love their-friends ; ‹ffClzris-
tians alone to love their enemies, says Tertul. ad Scap.

Hence we are instructed

1. That those are in error who think that the forgiving
of injuries and loving our enemies is matter of counsel and
not of precept: for the Apostle teaches us that this be-
longs to all the elect os God, lzoly and beloved, that is, to all
the regenerate.

2. They who forgive others profit themselves, yea, re-
move their own sins in some measure: whence in the Greek
the phrase is χαριζομενοι ἑαυτοις, remitting or jorgiving your
own selves. And Jerome writes on Ephes. v. What good one
does to another is laid up more for him who pevsorms tlze deod,
thanfor him for wlzom it is performed. And Christ most
plainly says, Matt. vi. 15, Ifye forgive not ‘men their tres-
passeS, neither will yom- lzeavenly Fatlzer forgive you your
trespasses.

3. No one walks so cautiously, but that he sometimes
offends against his neighbour both in words and deeds.
Hence the Apostle says, forgiving one anotlzer; as if we all
had need of this mutual forgiveness. Thus much as to the
actions required3 viz. fot-bearing and forgivz'ng.

[f any man have a quarrel against unffi] Here we have
the object or matter about which forbearing and jorgivz'ng
is to be exercised, viz. a quarrel, that is, some just cause
of complaint.

Here we must remark that all the words are put indefi-
