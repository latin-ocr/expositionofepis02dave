528 A nissER'rA'rioN ost THE DEATH os criflrs‘n

the Spirit of Christ bestows benefits on man which Christ
hath not merited for them? They will not dare so to tram·
ple upon the merit of Christ. Will they reply, That saith
and a good will, and the act of a beneficial application,
are not the special gifts of the Holy Spirit? They will be
ashamed of such gross Pelagianisni. Let them, then, con-
fess with us, That as through the death of Christ special
benefits are procured for the elect, so there was in the will
of Christ in dying, and of God the Father in accepting
his death, an effectual intention of procuring and confer-
ring them. And this is that singular privilege in the death
of Christ which we claim for the elect alone3 because it
appears from the fact, that God has destined that they
alone should be effectually saved by the death of his Son.
From whence (Heb. vii. 25) he is stated to be the Saviour
of some, that is, of the elect, altogether, viz. both meri-
toriously and efficaciously.

ARGUMENT 4. The commonly received distinction
among all Divines, by which it is said, That Christ died
for all ειςθῖεῖεηΐζῃ, but for the elect effectually, will afford us
a fourth argument. For as from the former part of it we
have refuted the opinion of those who deny that the death
of Christ, according to the decree of God, is a remedy
effectually and infallibly to be applied to the elect: for
what other sense can there be of these words, He died ‘f'
fieclualfflfor tlze elect, than, He died with an absolute inten-
tion and effectual will of saving the elect '3 For if any one
perverts this distinction, as if the sense were, That the
death of Christ, which is sufficient for all, becomes even-
tually efficacious to some from the contingent act of the
human will, in the first place, he is refuted by the words
themselves3 since when it is said, Christ died for such and
suclz persons qffectually, we denote a singular efficacy pro-
ceeding from the special will of him that died, not flowing
from the contingent act of him that believes. Secondly,
Such an eventual efficacy is not understood even by the
Jesuits themselves in this distinction, but an efficacy spe-
cially intended and merited by him that died. Thus
