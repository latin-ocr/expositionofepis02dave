Again, No man can desire, or aslefor, or even know tlzis grace,
unless he should first receive it from God. What is more
plain, if Fulgentius be believed, than that quickening grace
is not given by God to all men, and that it cannot be pos-
sessed by any one to whom it is not given from above? If
plainer words are wanted, Iadd (from the book de In-
oarnat. & Grat. Jesu Christi, p. 89,) de wlzo prepares tlte
will, himself also gives it. If God should not give z't to man
by lais grace, man can never be willing to believe 2'72 God, be-
cause grace does notfind this will, but worlcs z't in man. You
see that the opinion of those Fathers who opposed the
Pelagians and Semipelagians, is in agreement3 That
quickening and saving grace is not given to all men, and
that a vitiated will can indeed, from its own depravsty,
loathe the grace which is not given to it, and repel it when
it is offered in the external means, but it cannot lay hold
of and take to itself this quickening grace by the strength
of its own innate liberty.

But since the very marrow of Pelagianism consists in
the way in which they pretend that quickening grace is
administered to men by God, and is accepted by men, let
us shew what the adherents to the Pelagian faction‚ and
what the orthodox Fathers, state on this subject, by bring-
ing forward the testimonies on both sides.

With respect to the Pelagians. They maintain that
quickening and regenerating grace so flows to all men from
the death and merit of Christ, through the mercy of God,
that to be quiclcened and regeneroted, or not {o be quiclcened
and regenerated, depends primarily on the will of man em·
bracing or despising grace. To this then their opinion
amounts, That saving grace is offered to all men, in Christ,
of the pure mercy of God, but is given to no one of his
absolute good pleasure. But if it should be particularly
inquired, Why is the saving grace of Christ given to one,
and not given to others? they answer, Because one is
willing to receive it when it is offered, the other is unwil-
ling. But let them speak for themselves. Vitalis of Car-
