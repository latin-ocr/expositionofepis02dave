but that this death of Christ, God so ordaining it and re·
revealing it in his word, is that ransom by which the sins
of any man may be expiated who performs the conditions ’
required in the Gospel. And hence it is that the preacher
of the ,Gospel may confidently announce to every man in
every part of the world, that salvation is procur-able for
him in the death of the Son of God, if he should believe.
This cannot be promised to any of the fallen angels.
Whence it is clear, that this conditional promise of salva-
tion in the death of Christ, which may be announced to
every inan is founded on some ordination of the will of
God, which regards men universally and individually, and
does not regard angels. But let the opponents say what
this ordination is, if it is not that which we assert con-
cerning the death of Christ being applicable to the human ·
race under the conditions of the Gospel, These things
being so determined‚ we come nearer to the solution of
the aforesaid objection, that the death of Christ perta‘ins
to all men individually, as to his death itself, or the obla-
tion made on the cross. For as we can truly announce to
every man that his sins are expiable by the death of Christ
according to the ordination of God, and will be expiated,
if only he should believe in Christ3 so also we can truly
declare, that the same Christ was raised again, that he
mightjustify him through saith, and was exalted at the
right hand of God, that, by his mediation and merits, he
might preserve him through saith in the favour of God, and
at length might lead him to glory. Therefore we do not
put asunder those things which God hath joined together,
but we teach, that the death, resurrection, and intercession
of Christ are joined together in indissoluble union‚ but in
a different way. If we consider the whole human race,
that is, each and every man, then we say, not only that the
death, but the resurrection arid intercession of Christ re-
gards them, as to the possibility of their enjoying these
benefits, the condition of saith being pre-supposed. If we
consider the elect, we affirm that all these things regard
them as to the infallibility of enjoying them, because of
this condition of faitli being destined for, and in time 1)ου
