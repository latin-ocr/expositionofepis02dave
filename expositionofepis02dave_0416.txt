and announced to every morta13 although every one will
not claim for themselves their right in this novenam, yet
there is no one to whom it is not lawful. through the merit
of the death of Christ, to promise this to himself and to
claim it according to the covenant, If I believe, I shall be
saved. Itis established, as to all men individually, but
through some special kind of providence of God over-
ruling it, it is revealed and made known to some and not
to others. .

It remains, in the third place, tha-t we should explain
what was laid down in the proposition, respecting tlze Da·-
vine ordination depending on tlze aforesaid caverant, according
to wbz'clz, remission (ff sins and eternal life is decreed to be ex-
bibited to every man, under the possible condition offaitlz.
And here that only needs explanation which we affirm, that

sel] tlzis general gift offaitli witli special diligence. See
more on this opinion in the work itself. Although, there-
fore, he calls faith a gift, yet he intimates that it is a na-
tural ancl general gift, as though it were possible to elicit
this act of believing by the power of free-will. But from
this we are altogether averse, nor have we regard to this in
saying that the condition of faith is possible. Moreover,
neither do we found this possibility of believing in any su-
pernatural gift received by all. For we dare not maintain,
