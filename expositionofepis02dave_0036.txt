wipe away all tewsfrom their eyes, Rev. vii. 16. Thirdly, in
the perfect love of God, which succeeds to our imperfect
love, and shall perfect it for ever: Prophecies shall fail,
tongues shall cease: bat love izeverfailelli, 1 Cor. xiii. 8. But
indeed, what of glory and of happiness shall it not com-
prise'? To see, to love, to enjoy God l we are not only not
able to express it, but we cannot comprehend it in our
mind: For truly says Gregory, Moral 27. 26, When mortal
man would discam-se about etei-nal glory, 'lie disputes as one
blind about light.

That glorious robe of the body consists in the various
endowments with which it shall then be adorned : In
brightness3 T lie rigliteous slzall sliineforllz as tlte sun, Matt.
xiii. 43: in exemption from suffering3 this corruptible shall
put on incorruption, lCor. xv. 53: in agility3 which, ac-
cording to Augustine, shall be such, that wlzerever tlze spirit
flies, there shall the body also jbrtlzwitlz he. Other things
were likewise added by some of the Schoolmen3 but it is
not my purpose with over nicety to define any thing about

glor'y ; ic is sown in wealtness, it is raised in power ‚· it is sowa
a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If any one de-
sires to see more about the state of the blessed‚ let him
consult Prosper, De vit. contempl. lib. i. cap. 43 Parisi-
ensis‚ De universo ; Albert, Compend. lib. vii. cap. 23,24,
&Q Thomae Summ. part. iii. qu. 82. art. 1, 2, διο.

And thus much concerning the gift of glory, the time of
the bestowment, and Christ the givet thereof. Now, in the
second place, we shall consider how wonderfully all these
things conduce to the contempt of earthly, and the desire
of heavenly things. “

First‚ then, that state of glory promised to us and daily
expected, ought to move us to despise earthly things. For
if the heirs of an earthly king should disdain to be occu·
pied in low and abject employments3 how much more does
it behove those destined for a celestial kingdom, to tread
under foot the lusts of earthly things? That saying of
Alexander is worthy of remembrance, who, when invited
