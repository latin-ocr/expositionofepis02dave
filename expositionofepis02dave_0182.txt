172 AN exrosvrion OF ST. PAUL’s Chap. iii.

in Isaac, who withheld not his obedience to his father even
unto death, Gen. xxii. 9, and in Christ himself, in his sub-
mission to his parents, Luke ii. 51.

But here a question may arise concerning married chil-
dren, or those called to the administration of Church or
State, whether they are still bound to obedience to parents,
and how far?

We answer, That filial obedience is perpetual, and is to
be rendered even to the last breath of lise: which is mani-
fest from the command itself, Honour thy father, that ῐΙιοιι
mayest live long upon tlte eartlz. Therefore, so long as we
live here, so long is the obedience of honour due to pa-
rents3 but not in the same manner and degree. Children,
then, living in the paternal house, and under the paternal
power, are bound to yield reverence, obedience, and as-
sistance to their parents, and that in matters of domestic
care, or in other matters according to their command and
will. If parents would have them to remain at home, and
aid them in household duties, they ought not to refuse; as
is plain from the parable of the two sons, Matt. xxi. 28.
If they wish to employ their labour to accomplish some

outer business, in this also they must obey, Tob. V. 3. But
⁴ as to married children, or those called to administer the
Church or State, the case is different. For although all
these are yet bound to revere, obey, and even to render
assistance when occasion offers3 yet they are not bound,
as before, to dwell with them, nor to labour at the domes-
tic business of their parents3 because now they have their
own and more weighty business.

With respect to married children this is plain 3 because
the husband from the Divine ordination ought to leave his
father and his mother to cleave unto his wife, Gen. ii. 24.
Which we must not understand abstiaetedly, but compa·
ratively, and in respect of individual fellowship and coha-
bitation: for he ought to labour for the support of his fa-
mily, Gen. xxx. 30.

Now as to those who have undertaken ecclesiastical
duties3 they cannot be recalled by the authority of parents
to the persormance of their ‘earthly business. For if a
