Chal). vii. As ιτ REGAnns Tun rasnnszA'i-izn. 519

God the Father to Christ the Mediator, which it has been

shewn is to be understood of the elect. Secondly, That

Christ in discharging his office of Mediator and Saviour,

embraces and regards them with a special love, attention,

and care, that is, with such love, attention, and care as

may produce in them the infallible effect of eternal life.

Which manifestly appears from Heb. ii. 13, where Christ

represents to his Father that those children who had been

given to him by his Father were preserved and saved, Be-

hold, I aad tlte children which God siocli given me. Now that

we may bring all these things into a small compass,Those

whom Christ commended to the Father by special interces—

sion, that is, by absolute prayer, as Bannes expresses it (in

l, qu. 23, art. 5, p. 297) or as Suares says (in 3, t0n1.‘
l, quaest. 19, disp. 31, p. 634) for whom he prayed willa

an effectual and absolute will, that the merit o] his deatli mngllC
he ‹ffectually applied to thena,- for the preserving and keep-
ing of whom he watched in an extraordinary manner3 for
whom he so sanctified himself, that they might effectually
receive from him that sanctification which is produced in
the hearts of those who are saved by the doctrine of the
Gospel, and moreover‚ whom he will place altogether at
length before his Father safe and glorious : these persons,
beyond all controversy, he also embraced with a special
›design in the very act of his offering‚ and so likewise in
the whole work of redemption. For it is absurd to say,
that bya special desig-n, salvationi was procured hy the
Mediator for those persons for whom the death of Christ,
which is the cause of the salvation of mankind, was not
destined by a special design.

3. A third argument is derived from those Scriptures in
which the death of Christ, -when joined, and as it were
connected with his certain and absolute purpose of giving
eternal life, is not extended to all men, but is limited to
certain persons, and that according to the special design
of Christ himself. Such as (John Χ. 15) Ι lay down my lffie
jor the sheep. (John xi. 51, 52) He prophesied that Jesus
should die, διο. that he should gatlter together in one tlze chil-
dren of God tlmc were scatcerecl abroad. (Ephes. v. 25, 26)
