able to assist and sustain their parents 3 because this is op-
posed to the Divine command.

2. It is lawfnlfor α man, against the will of his wife,
after the period oftlze marriage contract, to belalre himself to a
monastic life ; therfffore z‘t is much more lawsulfor a son to do
that against the will of lzz‘sfather.

Ianswer, That it is lawful by the canonical and anti-
christian law3 but by the Divine law it never was lawful:
for niatrimony, from the moment of contract, is true and
confirmed matrimony, although not consummated. This
very constant, therefore, transfers the power of the hus-
band’s own body to his wife, and the wife’s to the husband:
the husband therefore cannot against the will of the wife,
defraud her of her right. What the Schoolmen pretend,
that the monastic profession is a spiritual death, and that
by this death marriage is dissolved no less than bodilyv ex-
istence, is so ridiculous, that it needs no refutation: for to
die spiritually to the world and sin, is the duty of all
Christians, not of the monks only.

I answer, Children after the years of puberty do not
immediately so become their own masters, that they may,
without sin, neglect the counsel, throw off paternal rule,
or slink away from horne at their own pleasure. Nay, we
constantly see in the Scriptures‚ that pious children, even
after their fourteenth year (which is fixed as the mark of
puberty) obey their parents, and yield to their commands‚
even in those things which relate to their person : as Jacob
did in choosing a wife, and Isaac before him: So virgins
did not take to themselves husbands without paternal appro-
bation: Exod. xxii. 173 Deut. vii. 33 l Cor. vii. 36. It is
therefore false, and contrary as well to Divine as to hu-
man laws, which Bellarmin takes for granted, That every
damsel after her twelfth year, and every youth after his
fourteenth year, may, against the will of their parents, de-
