Ver. 5. EPlSTLE To Tne comssmus. 47

Pudicitia, speaks of this uncleanness: leose impiousfuries
of lases, says he, contrary to nature itseff, we remove not only
from the threshold, butfrom the whole lzouse (ff tlte Chardi ,-
for they areflot sins merely but portentous ver-mins* There-
fore, because the unrestrained appetite of the lustful is
wont to proceed sometimes from fornication to this unclean-
ness3 so, after fornication, the Apostle declares that all
other uncleanness is also to be mortified.

Observe, 1. There is no sin so foul, so foreign from hu—

manity itself, into which the inbred corruption of our na- ,

ture may not impel a man not yet mortified.

2. ,Lesser sins pave and fence a path, as it were, to
greater3 this uncleamtess always follows in the train of for-
nication z Hence says the Apostle, Ephes. v. 3, But forni-
cation (cml all uncleanness.

3. To avoid greater sins, it is most safe not to tolerate
the lesser, but as much as in us lies to root them out. If·
you resist vice at its birth there will be no growth to worse ;
but if in this you indulge ever so little, the iniquity in-
creases.† Thus far we have contended against the exter-
nal acts of lust.

Πάδος] Some translate this (ff'eminacy, others lust.‡
The Apostle teaches that after all the external acts of lust
have been repressed‚ the internal motion itself‚ and the
unbridled passion must be restrained. 112909, then denotes
that disposition of the mind whereby any one is fitted and
ready for the sin· of lust, when any occasion is offered3
and because this vice arises from the effeminacy of a mind
unwilling to sustain the attack even of the least tempta-
tion, therefore some not improperly render 11an qffemz'nacy.
For they are justly deemed effeminate whose minds do not
resist the temptations of the flesh3 but willingly and im-
mediately yield themselves to the bonds of lust, even as
Samson yielded himself up to be bound by Dalilah.

³· Alluding probably to the abundance of particular insects as an indica-
tion of impending judgments ς as in the case of the plagues of Egypt.

“ The great evil and danger (gf Little Sins.'’

ζ In our version it is translated inordinate affection.
