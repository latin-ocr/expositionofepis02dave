We will call llze damsel, and inquire ot lter mouth. And they
called Rebecca, (md said unto lzer, Wilt thou go willa this
man? And slze said, Iwz'll go. 2. If they would beware in
contractsng matrimony, lest they choose husbands for the
sake of honour or riches, who, they are sure, do not love
them cordially. 3. Lasssy, if after contracting marriage,
they carefully avoid even the most trifling occasions of of—
fence: for as things cleaving together in the beginning are
rent asunder by any sudden blow; so also is it with the
fresh love of those just united in marriage. But God also
should be constantly invoked, that he would pour the bond
of true and holy love into 111011· bosoms: forlascivious and

as says Augustine, De doctr. Christ. 4. 21, more dishonest
to meditate by adultery qs tlte eoemtenance, tlze adultery of
chastity. If, therefore, they will study ornament, they
should hear Tertulli-au, De cultu faemin. Let them bort-ow
