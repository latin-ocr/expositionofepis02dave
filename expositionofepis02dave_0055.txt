Ver. 5. EPlSTLE 'ro THE cotossmNs. 45

2. What they affirm, that brothels are to be tolerated
lest married women should be violated, is contrary to the
Divine command, Deut. xxiii. 17, There shall be no wlzoreof
the daughters (f Israel, διο. It is contrary to Apostolic
doctrine3 which would have matrimony‚ not fornication,
to be the remedy for lust. It is contrary to the received
opinion of Theologians, who deny that a compensation of
sins is to be admitted: Harlots, therefore, are not to be
prostituted lest married women should be violated. Lastly,
it is contrary to the duty of the Christian magistrate ; who
is bound, as much as in him lies, to take care that all may
live piously, soberly, and righteously: Rom. xiii. He
ought not, therefore, to suffer those who openly profess
whoredom.

3. With respect to the remark of Augustine, Take away
har-lots from human society aud you will distat-b all things by
lust; we answer, it is not of much viseight: because he-
wrote those books De ordine, when he was a young man,
and not then baptized, as is evident from the first of his
Retractationsfif‘ We also oppose to it the more serious of
the Fathers. Lactantius, Instit. lib. 6, cap. 23, says, The
devil set up brothels, and published the shame <ff unhappy
women. Clemens, Paedag. 3. cap. 3, Brothels are troplzz'es of
public intemperance. Tertullian, de cultu faeminar. calls
harlots tlte most unlmppy victims ofpublic lusts. But now
how disgraceful to the Christian magistrate, if he defend
the inventions of the devil, if he suffer that victims be
publicly immolated to lust, if, in short, he do not demo-
lish the trophies of intemperance. Resides, I say, that
however diligently the magistrate may endeavour to re-
press fornication, yet he can never wholly remove from
human society harlots or fornicators, no more than he can
remove thieves or murderers. =Therefore the Papists may
dismiss this sear.

³* The use of AugustIne's opinion in this matter, at atime when he was
no Christian, is quite in papistical keeping, as to the mode of sheltering
themselves under autnority, or wresting the sentiments of the Fathers to
their purpose. Of this many of thsir modern writers furnish eminent ex-
amples, as recent controversial works amply exhibit.
