him, the Saviour of the world; John iv. 42, This is indeed the
Christ, the Savionr of the world. They call the death of
Christ, α ransomfor all, 1 Tim. ii. 6, given for the redemp-
tion of all, and the propitiation for the sins of the whole
world, ·l John ii. 2. The Catholio church also, in her pub-
lic prayers, has always named Christ the Redeemer of the
world. But lest any one should pervert titles of this kind
to that sense, as if Christ were called the Redeemer of the
world because he hath effectually redeemed the elect dis-
persed through the whole world, I add this at the last, that
both the Fathers and modern writers have asserted, that
Christ is the Redeemer of the world in the sense laid down
by us, namely, because his death is a ransom from the or-
dination of God applicable to all men individually. To
this those words of Prosper apply (Ad Object. Vincentian.·
Resp. 1.) On account (ff one nature of alt and one cause of
all under-taken in truth bzs our Lord, all are rightly said to be
redeemed, although alt are not delivered from captivity. ‘And
a little after, The cnp of immortality which is made up (four
irfirmity and Divine virtue, hath indeed in itself what may be
beneficiat to alt, but ij it is not drunlc, it does not heal. Those
words of Musoulus before quoted refer to the same thing
(Common-places, p. 151). We lcnow that alt do not become
partalcers of this redemptiw, buc the perdition of those who
are not saved does not prevent it from being called universal
redemption. For it does not arise from any defecc z'n the grace
of God that reprobates do not receive it, nor is itjust that on
accountcff the sons of perdition tt should lose the glory and
title of universal redemptzon, since tt z's prepared Jbr all and
altare called to it. From all which it appears, that Christ
is rightly called the Redeemer and Saviour of the world,
because he has brought to the whole human race a remedy
applicable to the procuring-of the salvation of every indi-
vidual.

6. If it was the counsel and will of God, that Christ
by dying should pay to Him a most full, perfect, and suf-
ficient satisfactioni, not only to deliver those who believe
in the benefit of God, and thus eventually are saved, but
