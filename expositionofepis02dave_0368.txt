creature. If any one preacher could go over the whole
world, and come to every individual mortal, it would be
lawful for him to offer Christ to every man, and, under the
condition of faith, to announce and promise salvation to
be obtained through Christ. For thus the Apostle himself
speaks, Romans iii. 21, 22, Now the righteousness of God
without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and
the prophets ; even the righteoasness (ff God, which z's by saith
