assert, that all labour under this disease until they are
healed by the remedy of special grace. Nor do any of the
unregenerate by a better will than others, attract grace to
themselves, but they receive a better will through effica-
cious grace given to thern of the mere good pleasure of
God, according to the saying of the Apostle (Rom. ix. 16,)
It is not (f him tlmt willeele, nor of him thot rzmneth, but <ff
God that sheweth meret) ,⁰ and Phil. ii. 13, It is God which
worlcelh in you both lo will ancl to do oflzz's good pleasme. To
this Prosper refers the difference between believers and
