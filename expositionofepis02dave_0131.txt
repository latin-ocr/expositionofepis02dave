the actions of all the other virtues, not elicitiwly, but impe-
ratz'vely.

Thirdly, they have their firmness and alacrity from cha-
rity. Whence Gregory (in cap. 28. Jobi) says, If any work
be found destitute of ellarity, it is immediately taken (nvay by
tlte tempter. And Aquinas (Quaest. disp. de charit. art. 2)
remarks, that it is the peculiar property of charity, that
in exercz'sing tlze other acts of virtue, charity forces us to acc
voluntarily, promptly, witlz deliglzt, and with firmuess. On
these accounts the Apostle assigns to charity the first
place among the virtues, and admonishes us to put it on
either above all these or on account of them all. We come
now to that encomium or eulogy of charity expressed by
the Apostle in these words, ,

T lze bond of perfectness] a figurative expression. For he
calls ita hond from the similitude of the effect, since it
joins and combines together things differing from one

perfectness. Some refer this perfectiore to the virtues,
others, to the church. The former say charity is the hond
qs persectness among virtues themselves3 since he who hath
cliarity hath all the other virtues, and practises them;
which the following Scriptures hint at3 Rom. viii. 8, He
wlw lovetlz his ¹neighbour hatlzsulfilled the law. Galat. v. 14,
All the law issulfilled in one word, wamelis tlzz‘s, T hou skalt
love thy neighbour as thyseff. Whence Cyprian says, In
love, are combined alt the volumes of tlze ScriptureS. In this
all religion is consummated. It is consequently called the
hond qs perfectness, since it joins and binds together the
duties of all virtues : so that wherever true charity is, there
is found the whole body and connexion as it were of all
virtues. But when this sense is allowed, the Romanists
fall upon us, and object3 .

If charity be the perfect fulfilling of the law, then does
itjustify: for they who perfectly fulfil the law are justified
by the works of the law, yet this is impossible according
to the Apostle, Rom. iii. 20.

We reply, the fulfilling of the law may be considered in
a twofold sense, coner-:ming the parts of the righteousness
