the world, being born without sin, living without sin ; though
innocent He died for all those who are predestinata] to ltfi’.
And as Prosper says, and John Chrysostom‚ and other Doc-
tor-S, although all do not believe, He did his part, dyingfor
all. A. little after, on those words, God was in. Christ, re-
conciling the world unio himself, 116 says, Through Christ He
reconciled to himself tlze world, that is, all those who were pre-
destinaled. ln the 2d Chapter to the Hebrews also, he
mentions both opinionS‚ in the same words as we shewed
Remigius had used before. We see, therefore, that these
holy Fathers did not much care for that anathema fortified
by the authority of Councils, which Faustus brings for-
ward; but notwithstanding retained to themselves the li-
berty of writing and speaking. Yet I think that it ought
to be added, that those Fafflers, when they restrict the death
of Christ to the predestinate‚ do not do it absolutely 3 but'
in consideration of the saving effect which, by means of
faith, it brings to them alone: and on the other hand,
when they extend this death of Christ to all, they do not
extend to all that special will of God in calling them ac-
cording to his own purpose, in giving thern faith, and ef-
fectually working in certain individuals according to his
own counsel and operation, that they may reap the benefit
of the death of Christ. Therefore they so understand the
universality of redemptioni that they did not subvert the
secret counsel of predestination, 111 which thing they dif-
fered widely from the Pelagians and Semipelagians. 'l‘hey
also understood redemption in such a restricted sense, that
at the same time they acknowledged that it pertained to all
men individually under the condition of faith. While
Haimon himself (whom we just mentioned) was living,
new tragedies were brought forward about this question of
the death of Christ. For one Godeschalcus, a Monk, as
Flodoardus* has recorded-(Hist. Remens. 3. 14), that he
