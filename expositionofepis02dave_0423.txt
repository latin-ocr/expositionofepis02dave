regard to the apostate angels, and of which it may be
truly said, that Christ did not die either effectually or suf-
ficiently for the fallen angels.

OBJECTloN. But perhaps some one may meet this ar-
gument,and assert, That the mere sufficiency of the thing
offered, considered in itself, makes out as to men, that
Christ may be rightly said to have suffered for all suffi-
ciently3 but does not make it out as to devils, because
(Ames, Coron. p. 99) that that ransom ῖς not sufficient wln‘clz is
not apt and saitable. But agreatpart of the aptitude z'n Christ
to take away the sins of mankind consisted in lzz‘s assuming tlte
Zilceness of sz‘nfnlfleslz. Since, therefore, lte did not talte on
himself tlte nature (ff angelS, ke was not z'n a suz‘table condition,
nor was lzz's death snfficz'ent lo take away the sins <ff the evil
angels. ’

ΒΕΡιΥ. This argument is unsound in both parts. For
that sufficiency, (whatever aptitude and congruity it may
have) if it has not also some ordination and act of offering
relative to individuals‚ does not make out that Christ can
be said to have suffered altogether for such persons, much
less that he can be affirmed to have suffered for them suf-
ficiently. In vain, therefore, is Christ’s assumption of
human nature brought forward by those who contend that
he died for the elect alone, to deduce from thence that he
suffered sufficiently or insufficiently for all mankind. The
exception is also weak on the other side, because, although
there was not that similitude of nature between Christ and
angels which there was between Christ and mankind, yet
this could not hinder that the ransom paid by Christ, that
is, the blood of God, should be in itself, on account of its
own value, most. sufficient to take away the sins of angels
also. For what guilt of any creature can be so great, that
the blood-shedding of God could not suffice for its expia—
tion, which is of infinite valde from the dignity of the Di-
vine person3 and therefore, notwithstanding the dissimili-
tude of human nature, if God had deigned to grant this
right in the death of Christ to angels, it would also be
applicable for the redemption of angels. God indeed was
willing to have compassion upon the human race, and not
