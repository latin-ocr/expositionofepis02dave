We ought not, therefore, to be withdrawn from discharg-
ing this office, either on the ground of our own advantage,
or of pleasure and ease3 nay, it ought to be the most de·-
sired and fruitful gain to a minister, that by his constant
labour he may win souls to Christ3 this ought to be his most
delightful and acceptable pleasure, thatby his ministry he
daily renders many pleasing and acceptable to God the
Father by Christ, as the Apostle insinuates, 2 Cor. ii. 2,
Col. i. 28. Some one of the Roman emperors formerly
said, that αη emperor ought to die standing; we should no
less boldly declam, that a minister os the word ought to die

though they admitted the authority of the Church in de-
termining rites, yet thought that in matters of saith it
should be bound to the rule of the Scriptures alone, and to
add any thing to this rule they thought to be perfidious.
Ι will add some testimonies from the Fathers‚ because the
perfidious Tridentines have thrust so many dogmas upon
the Church, and that under an anathema, most of which
(by the confession of Papists themselves) have not a firm
foundation in Scripture. Hilary, lib. 6, De Trin. upon
those words HEAR Hm, says, I will Ιιεαν by all means, nor
will 1 hear any one else except him who hears him, or teoches
