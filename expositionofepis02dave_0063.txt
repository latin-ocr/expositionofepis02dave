Ver. 6. EPISTLE TO THE coLossmNS. 53

ing God, who givetlz us richly all things to ergjoy, 1 Tim.
vi. 17.

2. Nothing also is more base and flagitious than a co-
vetous man; because as much as in him lies, he thrusts
God frorn the throne of his Majesty‚ and sets up money in
his place.

3. This vice is to be avoided before all others z because
(to use the language of the Schools) it is most adhesive to
the creature, and most averaive from God ; but all the dis-
grace and defilement of sin consists in turning to the crea-
ture and departing from God.

4. Scarcely any one is wholly free from this idolatry· ‚
for we all cleave unduly to the creature, and thus incur
some stain of idolatry. But we must withdraw the mind
from them, and return to the love and service of God.

And thus much concerning the dissuasion itself from the
vices above-named. The confirmation thereof follows in

the two succeeding verses.

Verses 6, 7.

For which things’ sake the wratlz of God comella on the chil-
dren of disobedz'ence .-

In the which [με also walked some time, when με lived in
them.

The Apostle confirms the afore-mentioned dissuasive by
two arguments. The first is drawn from the destructive
consequence3 for those sins enumerated provoke the Di-
vine wrath; ver. 6. The second is derived from the remo-
val of the cause ς for in the regenerate inbred sin formerly
lived: now it is dead, ver. 7. In the former argument
three things are to be noted: 1. The cause of the event3
For which tlzings’ salse. 2. The event itself‚ viz. the out-

pouring of the Divine wrath ; tlte wrutle, qs God cometh. 3.
