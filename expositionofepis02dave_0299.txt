Ver. 12, nrlsTLE To THE COLOSSIANS. 289

cially required from them in the discharge of this sacred
ministry: Not to please men3 If I please men, says the
Apostle, Gal. i. 10, Ι should not be the servant (ff Christ:
not to be studious to promote their own advantage or
honour3 ·but to prove themselves the servants of Christ.
Now he serves Christ the best, who chiefly labours that he
may bring very many to the knowledge and obedience of
Christ.

3. Always labourz'ngferventZy for you in prayers, that pse
may stand perfect, δὶα] Lastly‚ he desires that Epaphras
may be rendered acceptable to the Colossians from his re-
markable love towards them. This he sets forth and proves
in a twofold manner: by its effect, in this verse3 by his
testimony, in the thirteenth verse.

Now here three things occur to be observedi 1. The ef· <
fect itself of love3 prayer. 2. The manner of the prayer3
which is expressed hy always ἷαύοιιγίἠὲΓ fervemus. 3. The
matter of the prayer3 that ese may stand perfect and complete
in all the will of God.

]. As to the first, namely‚ the effect of love3 true love
cannot flourish towards any one in the heart, without put-
ting itself forth in some work. For among all the affec-
tions, love is the least accustomed to be inactive: which
is no less true of holy and chaste, than of thatinconstant
and lascivious love, of which the poet speaks,

Sed mal& dissimulo ; quis enim celaverit ignem,

Lumine qui semper proditur ipse suo ‚7ss
But now among the many operations of sincere love, none
is more useful to the beloved‚ none more accordant. to the
minister, than this prayer whereby he pleads for the pro-
tection of God, and keeps off the plots and power of their
spiritual foes from his flock. And on this account, al-
though the Apostle could have named many other effects‚
from which he could have proved the love of Epaphras to-
wards the Colossians‚ yet he wished chiefly to insist upon
this work of prayer.

...............But Ι dissenible badly;
For who can e'er that fire conceal,
Which by its own light itself betrays?
