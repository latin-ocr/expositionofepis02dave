resistance or non-resistance of the human will, since the
Scriptures expressly refer this to the good pleasure of God
in being willing or not williug to shew compassion3 and
the Fathers in express words exclude the disparity of the

wills of'menbefore grace received.
Hitherto we have disputed about immediate means, let

us now descend to the external means, whereby these are
conferred. The death and merit of Christ had its efficacy

in the acceptation of God from the origin of the world;
yet, under the Old Testament, God did not grant to all
men every where the external means of its applicationi, but,
as the Psalmist says, He sheweth lzt's word uuto Jacob, sec.
He bath not dealt so with am] station (Ps. cxlvii. 19, ¹20.)
And of the same sentiment is St. Paul, (Acts xiv. 16) God
in times past siffred alt nations to walle in their own ways, ⁸
Prosper has noticed the same thing· (De lib. arbitr. p. 225.)
He says, It is not removed from common observatiam, what
countless numbers (gf mankind in so many ages have died, sunta
in their errors and impiesies, without any knowledge of tlze true
God. And looking to the times of the New Testament, he
says, (De vocat. Gent. ii. 17) There are also now, z'n the ex-
treme parts of the world, some nate'ons upon whom the grace (f
tlte Saviour laath not skohe. From which things it follows,
that, even the death of Christ being admitted, God is ne-
vertheless not bound, by reason of his goodness orjustice‚
to provide and offer to all nien individually the means
whereby they may apply Christ to themselves. For with
respect to God the argument well follows from fact to right
both affirmatively and negatively‚ God does this, therefore
he doesjustly ‚· God does noc do tlzis, therefore he z's not bound
by any right that he should do it.

OBJECTloN 1. Some persons meet this argument by-
The reason why the Gospel is not preached every where aris-es·
not So much from thz'S, that those who should preach z't are not
sent hy God, as because those who are sent refuse to go. This
is the opinion of Corvinus (contra Tilenurn, p. 105.)

Rsspm. But if God, by reason of his goodness and
justice, as it were from some kind of congruity‚ the death
of Christ being supposed, were bound to communicate to
