vation, which so many disadvantages seemed to oppose-
But it is redeemed for the most. part at a great price ε

Sometimes with the contempt and rejection of all ho-
nours and secular pleasures. For always a difficulty, oft-
times even ignominy and punishment, deter Christians
from the path of salvation. Of this unseasonableness he
makes a seasonable time to himself who, for the sake of
religion and righteousness, thinks it a 'noble thing to des-
pise the pleasures and delights of the world, to sustain
contumely and punishments: this the Apostles and mar-
tyrs did in the primitive Church. See Acts v- 41.

Sometimes by the renouncing riches and all external
good. For it was the custom of tyrants to strip and spoil
the true worshippers of God of all their goods. As often
as this happened, it allowed them to retain only the life
of saith, all things else were exposed to their will ; just as
travellers were wont to give all their stores to robbers, and
only bargained for their life. This Augustine has taught
us, in Epist. ad Rom. propos. 74, We must ποι resist ma-
gistrates, although they should unjustly take from us all our
temporal goods. Y e took joyfully tlze spoz'ling <ff ⁸your goods,

the fiereeness of persecution was so great, that not only
was it a penal, but a capital crime to embrace the true Re-

heathen emperors3 Such also were the times of Mary to

godly under the empire of the Scarlet Whore. They who
sallon these bitter times, might make blessed times of
them, namely, by rcdeeming the occasion and opportunity
of glorifying God by the voluntary pouring forth of their
blood. See Acts xxi. 13. In a word3 he is said to redeem
zlze time, who submits himself to conditions however un-
just (so that they are not unlawful) that he may cleave to
God, and retain saving saith and a good conscience.
