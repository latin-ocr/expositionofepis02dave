under this error, who yield a blind faith and obedience to
their prelates, as if they were the lords of the faith of
Christians. Compare 1 Pet. v. 3, and 2 Cor. i. 24.

3. ‘Christians may and ought to submit themselves ac-
cording to the flesh (i. e. in things external‚ doubtful, and
temporal) even to the unjust commands of those who are
masters according to theflesh. Thus Augustine, in Expos.

drinks, and is dmnlcen. This is a disease which should be
banished far away from Christian servants. Now he points
out the cause or fountain Qf this disease, when he forth-
