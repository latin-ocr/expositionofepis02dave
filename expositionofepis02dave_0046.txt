it from God as to its creation: Job x. 10, 11, Hast thow
mot poured me out as milk, and curdled me lilce ckeese? T hou
least clothed me with skira andfleslz, and least fenced me with
sinews. But this body of sin, and every one of its members
are in every respect ours: for God made man upriglzt : man
has rendered himself depraved and corrupt.

Earthly] So he calls vicious desires‚ because they
always tend to earthly things: because* they hold the minds
of men to earthly things3 because corrupt habits and af-
fections dwell only among earthly things, but are excluded
from heavenly ones: Rev. xxi. 27, There shall in no wise-
enter into it any thing that is defiled‚· and xxii. 15, Without
are dags, ἃς. This general exhortation to mortify our
earthly members being now explained, we deduce some
corollaries.

,Mortify {herefore your members which are upon tlze earth,

l. He is not risen with Christ who does not labour to=
mortify the flesh t for from the virtue of the death and re-
surrection of Christ communicated to us, there always fol-
lows a desire of mortification and holiness : Therefore, as
many as delight in the flesh, are not mortified, but are>
dead in sin.

2. A true desire of external mortification cannot exert ⁷

itself in men corrupt by sin, unless they have within them
the effective principle of internal mortification, the grace,.
Imean, of the Spirit of regeneration. Therefore, the ex-
ternal exercises which are sometimes wrought by the
wicked‚ and bear the resemblance of mortificatiom are
not the genuine effects of internal mortification, but false
appearance&

From the act commanded3 Mor-usq με, we infer,

3. That the regenerate themselves never attain such
perfect mortification in this life, but that they must always
strive to mortify themselves more and more.

4. If they relax in this desire, that which happened to
holy David may happen to every one, that he be carried
away by the impetuosity of his lusts‚ and, for a time, may

be a wretched slave to sin, over which he had before tri-
umphed gloriously.
