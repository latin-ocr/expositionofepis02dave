524 A DlsSERTA'rlON ON THE DEATH OF s‘ansT,

to form a confused promise concerning the salvation of
some persons, who were not then specifically marked out
by God himself. But if a determination were made by
God and Christ concerning the effectual salvation of this
seed through the death of Christ, it would follow, that
there had been an effectual and specific design with regard
” to their salvation, in the death of Christ. All the inter-
preters of this passage have so understood it, as to allow
that by the death of Christ a most effectual and most cer-
tain deliverance and salvation was promised to his mystica!
body, that is, the church, or the elect. Thus Luther says.
The posterity or seed of which he speaks, is the charch. HE
§HALL sEE His sEED,that is, heslzallhave a kingdom andrqyal
children. So Calvin observes, HE suALL sEE His sem),
signi es that the death (ψ’ Christ would be the cause of hegel-
ting an qffmring, because having died aml risen again, he should
acquire to himselfa pecztlt'ar people. Masculus does not dis-
agree when explaining the words, He shall see of the travail
ql his soul and shall be satessfied. Christ saw beforehand the
flowing together (ff the elect to be saved ,· he sees z‘t even now, and
he shall see it to the end of the world; and he τέ satisfied with
seeing it, because the pleasure of God his Father prospers in
his hand. These all agree that, according to the special
good pleasure of God the Father, the effectual salvation
of the chureh, that is, of some certain persons known to
God alone, was promised to Christ, as the fruit of his pas-
sion; and that Christ intended with a specific and effectual
will, and laboured for the salvation of these elect persons,
or this peculiar people individually given and commended
to him by God the Father.

OBJEcrioN. If any one should object with Grevincho-
vius, (Dissert. de morte Chr. p. 8 and 14) leat there was
not any absolute promise or will of God concernz'ug the effec-
taal redemption <ff any individaal persons, bat that God witled
or did not will the application cf the death of Christ to all
men z'rzclivz'dually not absolutely but conditionally,· He willea' it
to allis they hadfaith ; he did not will it ij they disbelieved:
and therefore, although Christ laid down his life, it was pos-
sible nevertheless that his death might not be applied to any ;
