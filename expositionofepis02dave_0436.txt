cape, allhonglc ‘here are many who imputet to themselves the
causes qf his death, wlzo are unwilling to be healed. We do
not, therefore, deny that the particle for in the sacred
Scriptures, when used about the death of Christ, sorne-
times denotes that special intention, according to which
d·eliverance from death and translation into life is infalli-

but we deny that this is so perpetually, or necessarily the

It appears now that the secret and absolute good plea-

Christ died for all mankind.

As to the first, It is certain, that through regard to the
death of Christ, the will of God is now otherwise ordered
towards all men individually than it would be without it.
For by this, that Christ in his own human nature suffered
death, without any other intervening medium, it has at
