124 AN EXPOSlTloN or sr. PAUL'S Clzap. iii.

3. What motives we have to render this duty of peace3
viz, two : the ordinance of God3 to which also με are called,
namely‚ by God ι our mutual relation3 because we are
members of tlte same body.

The peace (gf God.] This peace is either internal, which-
we call peace of conscience; or external and brotherly,
which we may call the peace of friendship. That former
is established between God and the conscience of every
individual whenever by saith he apprehends Christ, and the
remission of his sins for Christ’s sake, and God reconciled
and propitious to him. Hence says the Apostle, Rom. v.
1, Beingjzcstified bysaitlz, we have peace witlz God, through
our Lord Jesus Christ: and Ephes. ii. 14, He is our peace.
This peace cannot have its origin from any other source
than God: and hence it is named tlze peace (ff God, Phil.
iv. 7, lee peace of God which passetlc all understanding, &c.
The latter subsists among neighbours, and arises from cha-
rity3 and the Apostle has respect in this place principally
to this. Now this peace especially denotes that affection
of the heart which inclines it to love and seek concord, and
to procure and preserve it by all means: although he may
also design the external effect, that is, a peaceful state of
all things among Christians, which is wont to arise from
that peaceable inclination. This peace in either respect is
also from God. That peaceable affection is by the inspi-
ration of God3 and the effect, or that happy and peaceful
course of all things in the Church‚ is from the blessing of
God. Isa. xlv. 7 ; and lxvi. 123 Galat. v. 22.ss

Let it rule in your beares, Βραβευέτω ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις bucon]
Some render this, let ic bear tlze palm; others more aptly
(as it seems to me) let ic command, rule, or moderate. For
the Apostle would intimate, that this is the duty of this
virtue, to act as an umpire or steward amongst the other

³* The Translator is here so forcibly reminded ofthe beautiful and affect-
ing Collect of our Church for the fifth Sunday after Trinity, that he cannot
refrain from adducing it:—“ Grant, O Lord, we beseech thee, that the
course of this world may be so peaceably ordered by thy governance, that
thy Church may joyfully serve thee in all godly quietuess3 through Jesus
Christ our Lord.'’ May every Reader’s heart respond—‘⁶ Anien.'’
