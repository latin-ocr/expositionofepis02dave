this 01· that, he speaks precisely to the purpose. For the
consideration of our gratuitous election before the founda-
tions of the world were laid, ought not to induce us 10
310111, but influence us with eagerness to perpetual holiness
oflife3 since God hath chosen us to this end: as it is said
in Ephes. i. 4, he laath chosen us iu Christ, bcfore the-founda-
tion qf the world, that we should be holy, &a The same ap-
plies to temporal electiori, whereby we are called into the
Chureh, and separated for a peculiar people of God; for
this privilege also obliges us to cultivate holiness. This is a
stipulation God makes with the Israelites, Deut. xxvi. 18,
The Lord hath avouclzed thee this daz) to be his peculim* people,
that thou shouldest keep alc his commandments. So also Christ
stipulates with a Christian, 2 Tim. ii. 19, The Lord lcnoweth
them that are his : And let every one that ‘lameth the name of'
Christ departfrom iniquites. Let, then, every one who· be·-
lieves himself elect of God, live as the elect of God.

Those, consequently‚ who prate about their eternal
election, and boast of their Christian profession, while 111
111611 deeds and in their manner of life they shew 1116111-
selves neither elect nor Christians‚ are here reproved:
but as the lazy Greeks made a profession of philosophy,
so do these men of their Christianity τ ic was all ΙαίΙ»ι aml no

losophers3 for as Tertullian gravely argues, Apologet. cap.

Holy] That is by baptism and the sanctification of the t·-
Spirit. In the administrationi of baptism itself, Christians
are consecrated to God ς they are renewed after the Divine
image by the internal operation of the Spirit: in each rc-
spect they are called holy; by each they are bound to a
holy life. For whatever is consecrated to God, should in
¹some way participate in the Divine holiness. Hence that
passage of Levit. xi. 44, Ye shall be holffijbr Ι am holy ;
