538 Α DisSERTATloN on Tne DEATH or CHRlsT,

dying and offerino· himself with a special reoard for them.
And first from St.³Augusti11e:

TEsT. l. This is an eminent testimony (in Johan. tract.
48, p. 35⁶2, tom. 9,) Hozo did he say to them, Ye are not of
my sheep? Because he saw that they were predestinuted to
eternal perdition, not purchased with the price of his blood to
eternal lq'fe. A little after, Of those sheep, neither the wolf
seizes, nor the tlzz'ef 3167713, nor the robber lsills any one. He
who lcuows what he gave for them, is secure of every 0776 of
their number. From which words we collect two things:
first, That our Saviour offered the price of his own blood
in some special way for the redemption of the predesti-
nated3 in such a way indeed, as that from thence follows
their infallible salvation. Secondly, That he did not offer
his blood in the same way for those who were passed by,
or not predestinated3 from whence they are denied to have
been purchased with the price of his blood in order to eternal
lise: which is to be understood of an absolute and effec-
tual ordination to eternal life to be completed and brought
into act by the death of Christ.

TEST. 2. To this testimony another is allied (Serm. 50,
de verbis Domini, p. 194, tom. 10,) The predestmated 70676
7707 yet gutheted to2> aether,- but he knew them who laud p? edes
tmated iheum he 17776777 them who 1777777 607776 to 767166777 them with
his ozon blood. He saw them, though they did riotyet see him ;
he lcnew them, though they did uoc yet believe 777 him. What
is inore plain, than that Christ came into the world, that
he might redeem the predestinate with his own blood, and
that he redeemed those who were effectually and infallibly
to be brought to the participation of eternal life3 in which
way he never determined with himself to redeem the non-
elect.

TEsT. 3. The third testimony of the same Augustine,
w'e shall produce from his book, (de natura δι grat. cap. 5)
which is as follows, Those 77170 ore delivered, ure 77οί called
vessels of their own merus, but vessels <ff mercy. Of whose
mercis but hiS, who senc Chrzst ,163773 into this world to save
