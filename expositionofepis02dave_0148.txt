tlze word (ff Christ sufficiently, but even abundantly. These
remarks concerning the first part of this verse, in which
he excites to the study of the Scriptnres, may suffice.

Teaching and admonislzing one another in psalms and hymns
and spiritual songs, sz'ngz'ng with, grace in your hem-ts unio the
Lord.] ln the preceding words he excited the Oolossians
to the stndy and knowledge of the Scriptures3 now he
shews the manifold use of scriptural knowledge.

l. The first use is, that Christians' (even laics) should
mutually teach and instruct one another in things pertain-
ing to the faith3 and what knowledge they procured to
themselves from the Scriptures, they should employ to
edify their brethren when need ful. For although the busi-
ness of teaching pnblicly with authority rests upon minis-

teach his brother: as we read Apollos was instructed in the
doctrine of the Gospel by Aquila and Priscilla, Acts xxviii.

faithful men. Now this is done by imparting to them the
doctrine of the Gospel. l Cor. iv. 15.

We hence learn,

1. That it behoves the laity, not only to aim at their
own edification‚ bnt also their neighbour's.

2. The Papists grievously err, who scarcely permit the
laics (especially those who are in a hnmble condition) to
speak about the Scriptores, and the things pertaining to
Religiom whereas Paul exhorts them mutually to ceaclz one
another in these things.

3. A knowledge of the Scriptures is to be employed,
not ont of vain ostentation, not for sophistical skirniishing,
