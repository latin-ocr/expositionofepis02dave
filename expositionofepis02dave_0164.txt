154 AN nxrosmworz OF ετ. ΡΑυι’5 (ympni.

cap. 4. This is indeed difficult3 but the more difficult it
is, the more laudable, because all cherish their own man-
ners, indulge their own affections, and hate the contrary:
The melancholy do the merry lzate,
And wicty minds despise tlte sad.
Horat. Epist. lib. i. ep. 18.
It is, therefore, laborious, to strip off as it were her own
disposition, and put on another's. But this is necessary to
the wife, and is before all other things to be commended
in her. For as a mirror adorned with gems, and skilfully
polished, is nothing, unless it express a true likeness of
the person looking into it, so a wife, however endowed
and beautiful, is nothing, unless she render herself con-
formable to the manners of her husband. This study of
conforming herself to the disposition of her husband, I
think the Apostle has respect to in 1 Cor. vii. 37, where he
says, that the married woman careth how she may please her
husband. She often and seriously thinks,
Aml turns her rapl'd thought, now here now there,
that she may find out the way of pl-easing her husband:
this is the most ready way, if she study to accommodate
her manners and affections themselves, and frame them to
his.

Lastly, this subjection consists in performing those du·
ties and offices which are incumbent upon her. The first
duty is, to love her husband religiously, to minister to him
obligingly, and to be his help and solace in every condi-
tion of fortune: Gen. ii. 18. Love your lmsbands, says the
Apostle‚ Tit. ii. 4. She will do him good all tlze days of her
lffie, Prov. xxxi. 12. The duties connected with this are
those of taking care of the family and children, and admi-
nistering other domestic matters accordzng to tlte established
laws, as says Aristotle. On this account Paul bids wives
to love their leusbmzds, to be lceepers at home, Tit. ii. 4, 5.
And Plutarch relates, that the Egyptian women did not
make use of shoes, that they might learn to keep at home,
and be ready for domestic offices. All these things pertain
to the subjection of the wife: which let it suffice to have
discussed lightly: for it is not our purpose to discourse
largely on each of these particulars.
