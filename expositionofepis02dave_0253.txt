1. It is not in human power effectually to teach salva-
tion to the hearts of men, but this is to be attributed to
Divine power and grace. Thus the Psalmist, cxix. 18,
Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out
of thy law ‚⁰ and beautifully says Augusffine, in Epist. Joan.

man: if he be hot within who can teaeh, our babblz’ng is vain.
Teuchers and admonitions are as helpsji'om without ; he who

he has made the undertaking of their ministry effectual in
the hearts of men, yet, through indulgence and avarice,
