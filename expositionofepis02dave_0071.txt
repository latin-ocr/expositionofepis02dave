in most gross and grievous sins, not in the paths of God's
commands.

3. They who appear to walk in virtue, dazzle the eyes
of men by outward and pretended shew only; whilst they
really wa‘lk in sins, in which they live: for their deeds
correspond to the powers whence they derive their origin.

4. The Papists, therefore, err, who ascribe to these
works of carnal and unbelieving rnen, not only the praise
of true virtue, but the efficacy of qualifying for the recep-

speaks otherwise3 No true virtues dwell in the minds of the
ungodly: and Lactantius, lib. 6. cap. 9, leere is no doubt
but every ungodly man knows not God: and that all his virtues
