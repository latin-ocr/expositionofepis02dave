dead shut up in sepulchres. And this last best agrees with
the preceding word, mortz'fy: as if he had said, Not only
mortify your sins3 but as though they were dead remove
them from you, and put them away, and separate them
from you altogether as dead bodies.

Now the instructions to be gathered are these ε

l. Sin cleaves to the regenerate themselves, nor can it
be entirely eradicated : yet we must still labour to put it
off more and more every day.

2. We must not account sin a pleasure 3 but a thing to
be hated by a Christian as deadly poison, or to be avoided
as a putrid carcase. Now what it is to put away sin, by
what power it is done, and how far it can be done by us
in this life, we have explained in the exposition of the
fifth verse, at these words, Mortify therefore your members
which me on tlze earth: What is there said of the act of

sin itself: not this or that sin, but all sins are to be put

way of restrictiori to them, but by way of exemplification:
for both those which are specially named, and all others
besides (it is intimated) should be put off.

3. We are all prone by our nature and ready to run
headlong into all sins. For original and inbred sin, al-
though it is only one actually, yet is it virtually a whole
army of vices ς not unlike a seed, which is actually single,
but virtually all those which are produced from it. Their
corporeal constitution, and other external causes, make
some men more inclined to certain vices3 but there is no
actual sin into which a man may not fall, in whom the nur-
sery and fountain of all sin exists. We must, therefore,
be on our guard against and avoid them all. So much of
the general persuasion. Now let us come to the specifica-
tion of the particular sins, in that order in which they are
adduced3 and first to those of the heart.
