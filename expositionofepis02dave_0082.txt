72 AN EXPOSI'HON or ετ. ι)Αυι.“5 (ΣΙιαρᾸίἰ.

3. Those who exercise this art are not disciples of the
Apostle, but of the devil, and to him they give their assi-
duous labours: for he is called, Rev. xii. 10, lee accuser
of the brethren- Hence Parisiensis not unwisely calls evil
speakers and slandererS‚ the devz'l’s dog-teetlz, De moribus,
cap. ll.

We will now add other Corollaries which regard those
who willingly lend an ear to these detractors.

1. If, therefore, evil speaking is so great a crime, then
to hear evil speakers with delight cannot be void of sin.
For not only they who commit the sin are worthy of pun-
ishment, but they also who applaud these sinners. Icau-
not easily affirm wlzz'clz <ff these two is most censurable, to slan-
der, or to listen to slander, says Bernani, lib. 2, De consid.
ad Eugenium3 which is most true of tlte hearing what is
agreeable (to use a Scholastic phrase). Each hath a devil;
this in the ear3 that in the tongue-

2. It behoves a pious man to turn away from and to re-
prove blasphemers and slanderers3 nay, also to defend and
to extricate his brother, when wounded by their detrac-
tions. We should withstand them3 because, as the north
‘evinci drivetlz away rain, so dotlz an angry conmenmzce α back-
be'cz'ng longae, Prov. xxv. 23. We ought to succour a
wounded brother also: leoso prz'vily slandereclz lais neigh-
bour, him will Ι cut off, says the Psalmist, ei. 5. [ln-alfe
also tlte-jaws <ff che wiclfed, and pluclced the spoil out qf his
leeth, was among the consolations of Job, xxix. 17.

Respecting those injured and wounded by slander, the
pious in this case have their consolation ε

l. Because they may hence understand that the wicked
break out into these attacks upon the good, not so much
from theirjudgment, as from long-standing hereditary dis·
ease in their niinds. They ought not, therefore, to grieve
so much for their neighbour, as at the disease and mad-
ness of their slanderers.

2. Because slander harms not a good conscience. Nei-
ther does any one suffer prejudice from the opinion of
those who have no judgment: nor, ffprqurdice dotla arise
against them in this world, will z't in the judgment (ff God,
as Anibi-ose well remarks, De interpret. lib. ⁴2. cap. 3.
