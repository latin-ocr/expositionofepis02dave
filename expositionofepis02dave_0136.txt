keep tlze um'ty <ff tlze Spirit in the houd <ff peace, Ephes-
iv. 3.

3. Because this peace was observed and maintained by
the primitive Church with all earnestness. lee multitude
that believed were of one beart and (ff one soal. Acts iv. 32.

4. Lastly‚ this peace being violated, subverts the
Church which Christ would have to be perpetual. For α
kingdom dz‘vided against itself cannot stand .- but, like as when
many draw a cord in different directions, if it break, they
both fall the more heavily on either hand3 so when the
Church is agitated by strifes, detriment and loss come
upon all.

...... Domestic rents the people’s weal dz‘sturb ;
Internal discordsfail of peuce abroad :
........ For nouglzt unsociable is firm.

Prudent. in Psychom.

Thus much of the former incitement derived from the ap-
pointnient of God. But there is an additional incitement
to the cultivation of peace, because not only are we called
thereto by the Divine appointlnent, but we are moreover
bound to it by a certain mystical relation, which the Apos-
tle denotes in these words,

Ite one body] They who are citizens of the same repub-
lic, are mutually called upon and bound to keep the peace3
yet are they only united in one body politically: but they
who are members of the Church, are united in one body
supernaturally and mystically‚ so that they all depend upon
one Head‚ and are quickened and informed* as it were by
one spirit. This we are taught by the Apostle, Rom. xii.
4, 5, and 1 Cor. xii. 12, 25, 26, where he infers that there
ought to be no difference between the members of the same
body, but the greatest harmony of spirit and sympatby.

'¹‘ Omnes—vivificentur et quasi informentur ab uno Spiritu.

With radiant light, as glowing irfn with fire.'’
Milton.

sasernis, and moves, and animates the whole.''
