which was concealed from so many, God himself so order-

Ram 3. We willingly concede what relates to the
minor proposition3 which also the sacred Scriptures tes-
tify, and the Fathers acknowledge to be most true. In
Acts xlv. 16, Paul shews, that in times past God snff'ered alt
nations to walle in their own ways, without any knowledge of
Christ. And on this account, in Colossians i. 26, 27, he
calls the Gospel of Christ, the mystery which hatlz been hid
from ages and from generations, bnt now is made manifest to
his saints, to whom God would make known what is the riclzes
of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles. Hence
Prosper says On free-will; It is not remomdfrom common
observation in how many ages what an innumerable multitude of
men have died in their errors and impz'etieS, without any know-
ledge of the true God. And, On the calling of the Gentiles
(lib. ii. cap 7), In the extreme parts of the world there are
some natz'ons, on whom the grace of the Saviom· hath not, yet
shone. The minor proposition, therefore, being granted,
we say that the consequence of the major is invalid. For
God is not bound to procure the application of his re-
medy to any individual to whom he hath willed that it
should be applicable; which is evident as well in corporeal
as in spiritual remedies. Asthough, therefore, the death
of Christ is, from the ordination of God, and the nature
of the thing, a remedy of that kind, that it may be both
announced and applied to every individual of the human
race for the remissiori of sins, yet God is not bound by any
promise to procure that it should be announced and ac-
tually applied to every individual. God willed that the
death of his Son should be a treasure as it were deposited
in his own hands, from whence he might dispense to the
who-le human race wbatsoever regards the obtaining either
of pardon, or grace, or glory : but he willed also that the
actual communication of this treasure should remain in·
his own most free power, and from thence he should bestow
it upon ineu according to the good pleasure of his own*
will. Is it not lawsulfor me to do what 1 will with mine
own? Matt. xx. 15. We say, therefore, that the death
