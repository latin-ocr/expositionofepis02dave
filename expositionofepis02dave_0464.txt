nol to be believed that remission of future sius is now made.
For although indeed in Ille sight qs God tlzose things which. he

than according to that mode of dispensation by which his de-

actually brought to pass. Thus far this author. Remission
of sins is not then to be dreamt ost nor reconciliation to be
pretended except according to the manner of the dispen-
sation decreed by God3 that is, unless we first truly repent
and believe in the Mediator.

ARGUMssNT 4. The whole virtue aud efficacy of that
merit which Christ by his death procured for the benefit of
the human racc, as to its efflux and derivatim] to other

of evincing; and on this account mainly he was in 1615 selected by King
James to fill the vacant See of Salisbury‚ as was declared by his Majesty
on his being presented to do homage. He was consecrated by his own bro-

Archiepiscopate of Canterbury about five years before; and it is worthy of

them by every trait which could adorn the Episcopal office. The Rishop
both in manners and talents was superior to the Archbishop, who was him-

bnt mostly controversial. The one referred to above was a reply to a work
of Richard Thomson, whom there was occasion to notice at p. 448. The
Bishop finished the book only the day before he died, and it was published
by his Chaplain‚ the famous Dr. Featley, under the direction of the Arch-
bishop3 the full title running thus: In Ricardi Tlcomsoni Aozgli-Belgici dia-

Commentary upon the Epistle to the Romans, now in the Bodleian Library,
left by its author in a state quite ready for publication. W'ere this work
translated and given to the world, it would be an invaluable addition to that

part of sacred theology.
