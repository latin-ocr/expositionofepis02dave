Ver. 11. EP¹STLE 'ro THE COLossmns. 95

tinctions are not found in Christ, or in 3 spiritual state of
salvation. He who here affirms‚ that in the new man thuere
is neither hond nor free, in 1 Tim. vi. l, commands servants

’ wlzo are under tlte yoke, to count their own masters worthy of

all Ιιοηοὶιν, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blas-
pbemed. This also Augustine teaches in these words, ExpOS.
in Epist. ad Rom. propos. 72, It behoves us usfar as this lffe
is concerned, to be subject to powers ; but as to our believz'ng in
God and being called to his kingdom, we need not he subject to

Thus far it has been shewn, in opposition to this false
and vain presumption of many, that external circumstances
of any kind can avail nothing without this internal renew-
ing of the beart: and that no condition, however vile and
abject, forms an objection, if the Spirit of God be pre· ’

may be thought, in being sprung from Gentile or Barba-
rian, in being born in uncircurncision, or in any low con-
dition or mean station3 all these things are divested of all
disgrace and dishonour through Christ living in the renew-
ed3 and, consequently, this renewed state is of the utmost
value. For Clzrz‘st (regenerating them and uniting himself
with the renewed) is all that which is necessary to salva-
tion ; in all, namely‚ in all the faithful who are thus sanc-
tified and united to Christ. He is 311 things to them, me-
ritoriously: for since they become one mystical person
with Christ, he imparts to them the meritos his passion,
death, obedience, and righteousness3 and thus he is ‘made
to them (ff God wisdom, righteonsness, sanclffication, and re-
demption, l Cor. i. 30. He is 311 things to them effica-
