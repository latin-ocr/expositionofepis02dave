150 AN EXPOSlTlON OF ετ. PAUL'S Chap. iii.

God always andfor all things. Neither is this duty to be
performed on our own account only3 but we are bound to
give thanks to God also for benefits towards our brethren,
and so to the whole church. We give thanks to God always
foryou, δίο. says the Apostle, 2 Thess. i. 3. It is plain,
therefore, this duty of giving thanks is to be perpetual,

c.
&2 To whom are thanks to be given? To God the

Fatlzeu] It is usual in the Scriptures, to prescribe this
method as well of praying as of giving thanks, that each
act should be directed to the person of the Father. But
there is no other reason for this, than that the Father is

author, all good things are derived to us, by the Son's nie-
diation‚ and by the Holy spirit working the same in us.
That, therefore, the order of nature and of operation may
be indicated, we invoke the Father as much as possible,
we give thanks expressly to the Father: yet neither the
Son nor the Holy spirit is excluded from an alliance in this
honour, since the essence of the three Persons is the same.

affords us confidence in speaking with God : for when we
invoke God the Fatlier of Christ, saith immediately con-

3. By whom? By him ; namely Christ] By Christ the
Mediator, therefore, we ought both to invoke God, and
give thanks after that God shall have heard us calling upon
hin13 for our thanks will not indeed be pleasing to God,
unless by Christ and for his sake. Therefore it is proper
to acknowledge, that there neither hath been any merit in
us for obtaining blessings from God the Father, unless by
Christ; nor is there any faculty within us of giving the
thanks that are due, unless by the same Christ.

Instructions.
l. They who do all things in the name of Christ, will

always have copious matter for giving thanks to God, what-

ever things may befal them.
2. We ought to acknowledge the blessing of God in all

those transactions which happen well to us, not to attri-
