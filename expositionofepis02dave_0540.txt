530 Α DISSERTATION ΟΝ THE DEATH OF cuuls‘r,

offering, obtained that it should be rendered effeetual to
the elect3 but the elect did not render it effectual to them-
selves by any special apprehension flowing from their own
free-will.

ARGUMENT 5. We shall take our fifth argument from
the Divine predestination. Since, the predestination of
certain persons before the foundation of the world being
admitted, it is necessary to admit that in the will of Christ
in offering himself there was some regard and respect to
their salvation to be produced by the merit of his passion.
For whether we place the Divine election (according to our
mode of understanding it) before the deeree of his suffer-
ing, or place it afterwards, yet it will always remain firm,
that in the will of Christ, whether as about to suffer, or as
suffering, there was some effectual and singular intention
of effectually saving these persons, whether elected or to
be elected. Since the will of Christ is never without con-
formity to that of his Father: Therefore it is incredible (as
Suares hath rightly remarked, in 3. disp. 31, ξ 2, p. 635)
tlzat Christ did not otherwise offer lzis merit-§for those whom lle
knew to be elected by his Fatlzer tlzanfor others, since he saw
that it was tlze will ο] the Fatber thot they should be itfallilsly
saved, ancl not the others‚· and to lzis will lle conformed lzz'mseffi
in all things. To this also refer the words of the prophet
before quoted (lsa. liii. 10,) The pleasnre of the [ονε] shall
prosper iu his hand. Therefore, the election of some per-
sons to eternal life, which proceeds from the gratuitous
will of God, is put in execution through the merits of
Christ, and therefore it is not to be doubted, that the me-
ritorious death of Christ was specially and effectually des-
tined by the Redeemer himself, and offered to the Father
for the infallible redemptioni and salvation of these elect
persons. Excellent is the observation of scotus on this
passage, (lib. 3, dist. 19, p. 74> Christ saw beforelzand that
his passion was to be offered to the Fatherfor the predestinated
and elect, and thus in reality he (ffered it effectually ; ancl the
