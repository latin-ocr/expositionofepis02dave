Ver. 25. EPISTLE To THE COLOSfflANs. 211

2. Earthly masters, with whatever power they may be
armed‚ cannot safely or with impunity trample upon those
subjected to them: for themselves also are subject to God3
and every soverezgnzfiy is under a still higher Sovet'ez'g‘tzqy, says
Seneca.

3. In dealing with subjects or servants, they who are
set over them ought always to consider, whether what they
do is of that nature, that it may also be cleared from the
charge of wrong by God the Judge ε for an account must be
rendered at his tribunal.

4. They are the most miserable of all mortals, who
mostly afflict others by miseries : for they themselves shall
receive for all those wrongs which they have done. They,
therefore, doat who think themselves happy in this power
of doing wrong. Thus Sylla obtained the surname of ΙῗῖεἸιῙτ,4
even because he could with impunity murder his innocent
fellow citizens at will. ι

5. They who are under the rule and the power of others,
ought to be induced by no wrongs to neglect their duty:
but rather to continue at their duty, and leave their revenge
to God. Thus much of the comniination.

And there z's no respect ofpersons] There is in these
words an anticipation ofa lurking objection. Forit might
be objected on the part of masters, Who shall call us to
account for evil intreating a servant? Servants were ac-
counted as nothing. It is understood, according to the
opinion of Lawyers, that no wrongs could be done to ser-
vants. But suppose that we are ari-aigned 3 we shall either
escape through favour, or we shall avoid it by power, or
we shall bribe the judge himself by money. The Apostle
meets these notions3 and affirms, that the rule of Divine
and of human justice is not the same. Human tribunals
are very much like a spider’s web: they enfold the pow-
erless and weak3 but the mighty and the rich break
through by main force. But that Snpreme Judge is not
terrified by power, nor turned aside by favour, nor bribed
by the money of the wicked: there is at his tribunal 7¹10
respect of persons. This is well depicted by Job, xxxiv.
19, He acceptetlz not tlze persons of princes, ηον regarded! the
