438 Α nisSER'rATION ΟΝ THE DEATH OF CHRIST-

Judas‚ without controversy a reprobate, and says, lee Lord,
who raised Lazarus in the body, could he not mise ,Iudas in
mind? He could indeed, but lee would not. What Augus-
tine does not sear to affirm concerning Judas, we boldly
affirm concerning any living person, notwithstanding the
secret will and foreknowledge of God of the opposite,
namely, ‘that God can raise any one in mind, that is. can
give repentance, and saith, and saving grace3 because he
hath not revealed concerning any particular person, that he
will not do this, and of any one whatever he hath revealed
that he can do this by his ordinary power, while he is in
the land of the living. To this will we ought to submit
ourselveS, and not to conjecture about the possibility or
impossibility of things according to his will, altogether
unknown to us.

Lastly, Reason itself teaches, that God’s ordinary power
is not to be confined by the secret decrees of eternal pre
destination. First‚ Because we human beings perceive
that our power is not to be limited according to the plea-
sure of our will. He who hath most firmly determined
with himself not to give alins to a certain person, does not
on that account lose the power of giving3 and on the other
hand, he who bath determined to give to another, bath not
for that reason taken away from himself the power of not
giving. For, as he freely willed one of these opposite
things when 116 might have willed the other, so also he
freely does the one without losing the power of doing the
other. 1f this is the case with man, whose power is mut-
able, and liable to be lost, how much more with God‚
whose power is irnmutable, eternal, and always the same.

Secondly, Because if we make the ordinary power of
God to be bound, and as it were circumscribed by his eter-
nal and secret decrees, we cannot seek any thing from God
with a certain saith, Ι will not say that he will, but that he
can help uS. For instance, If I should perceive myself to
be assaulted by Satan with some grievous temptation, Ι
cannot go to God with an assuranee of saith, as if he were
able to deliver me, because it is uncertain to me what he
bath decreed from eternity respecting this thing. For a
