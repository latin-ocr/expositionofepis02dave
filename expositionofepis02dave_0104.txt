all things profits nothing to one who lives impurely‚ and
knows not Christ: for in Christ there is neither Barbarian

Bond nor-free] All these expressions have the same im-
port, and signify, that a high or low station in the world
is not to be considered by a Christian as if the one were
nearer, the other farther from salvation. The condition of
slaves among the antients was most unjust and wretched :
they esteemed slaves as only animated tools, which their
master could use as he pleased 3 yea, they claimed to them-
selves the power of life and death over them as over their
cattle. Notwithstanding this vile and abject condition,
the Apostle says there is no difference between the slave
and his master as far as concerns salvation: For the slave,
if he be renewed after the image of God, is acknowledged

remarkable than in this age of the extension of professed Christianity ἓ
Will it not be a matter of greater surprise to the world a few centuries
hence, that it was upheld in a corresponding existence, if not worse in re-
gard to the treatment of the Slave, by Christian Britain in the nineteenth
Century ἰ) Is the reasoning applied to the case in reference to the soul and
eternity less applicable now than it was formerly Ρ Let any one periise but
