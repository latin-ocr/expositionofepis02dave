tor Faustus of Ries* as a witness against PelagiuS, who,
under the pretence of opposing Pelagius, strenuously
maintained his cause, and every where attacked the Ca-
tholic Doctors, concealing their names. But however
serviceable a witness Faustus of Ries might be in this
business, Grevinchovius committed a gross error when he
thought that the above-mentioned opinion was to be attri-
buted to Pelagius. If he had ever looked into tlie books
of Faustus, he might easily have perceived that in that
place he was not writing against the Pelagians, but against
those who attribute all to Divine grace and mercy, that is,
against Angusiine, Prosper, and the rest of the orthodox‚
whom he babbles against, as zmlilce the rave of seclaries‚ but
le'lce to tlze Pelagians in implely- (Faustus, lib. i. cap. 3 and
6.) If, therefore, Grevinchovius desires to prove from this
passage that this opinion was heretical‚ he ought to exhi-
bit it as a mark of Augustinian, not of Pelagian heresy.
But in reality Faustus did the same as was before shewn,
from the objections of the Vincentians, and the Capitula
of the Gallican divines, other Seinipelagians had done:
That is, he calumniously imputed this opinion to Augus-
tine and the orthodox‚ as necessarily connected with the
doctrine of predestination3 which nevertheless they never
would acknowledge. But to return to Pelagius and the
Semipelagians‚ who it is certain erred in some things about
the death of Christ, although neither of the afore-inen-
tioned opinions was reckoned among the antients the error
of Pelagius. Pelagius himself erred, in the first place,
not direc'tly by extending the death of Christ beyond its
proper limitis, but indirectly and by consequence, by main-

a FAUs'rus, a learned melate, was a native of Britain, first became a
Monk of the Monastery of Levius, then Abbot of the same, and in 455
was chosen Bishop of Riez‚ or Ries, in Provence. He wrote against the
doctrines of election and reprobafion, which pieces have been abridged by
Du Pin. His character is drawn by Milner as opposite to the view here
given of it, as Milner's representation of Pope Gregory the Great is to the
views and testimonies of other historians and writers, Faustus was ba.
nished from his See in 481, and died soon after. Vide Cave, Hist. Lit. vol.
