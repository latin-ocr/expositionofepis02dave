104 ΑΝ EXPOSlTlON or ετ. ΡΑυι,’5 Clmp. iii.

Jer. ix. 13 Matt. ix. 363 Luke xix. 413 2 Cor. xi ⁶29.
Hence that saying of the Poet‚ lee good are tear-almunding

3. We have, lastly, the conformity of nature, and the
possibility of suffering similar things. For nothing is more
agreeable to nature, than to be touched with the evils and
misfortunes of those who are partakers of the same nature
with us. This the Apostle points out„Heb. ii. 17, where
he says of Christ, that ic bekoved him to be made like his
hretliren that he might be α mercffal and faithful High priest-
The possibility of suffering similar evils, when seriously
considered, forces mercy from any man that is not desti-
tute of feeling: For what has happened to some one may
happen to any one3 which even Aristotle acknowledges,
Rhet. 2. cap. 18.

Hence we conclude,

1. The apathy (ἀπάθεια) of the Stoics must be exploded
by a Christian3 as not agreeing either with our natural con-
dition or our supernatural regeneration. Prosper, De vit.
contempl. 30, 31, well remarks, We are not infaultsor hav-

ing qffiffctions, hutsor making α bad use of them.

2. Bowels of mercy are found in every regenerate per-
son z he is therefore moved at the very first view of another’s
misery.

3. They who, ere they can be excited to mercy, must
have much solicitation, bewailing, and clamour from the
afflicted, can lay claim to little or nothing of the spiritual
man ε they who are not moved by these, have nothing hu-
man in them.

Kindness] From the affection, the Apostle passes to
the act; because the pity of the rich without kindness is
but the illusion of the wretched. Augustine properly de-
fines true pity to be, compassion in our beart for another's
dz'stress, such as wid lead us to assist where we are able. T ltus
hy compassion the mind grieves, says Gregory, as the liberal
hamt slzews tleis qffection of grief} Consequently, these two,
‘mer-cy and lcindness, must always be joined together, as
James recommends, Chap. ii. 16, and John, 1 Epis. iii. 17.
Whatever they pretend, they who have their hands closed,
