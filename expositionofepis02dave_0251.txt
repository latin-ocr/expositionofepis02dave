truth flowed from God. Thus Clemens, Strom. 7, near the
end, says3 The Grecian philosophy, if any magistrale pro-
hibited it, immediately died away ,· but ow· doctrine, eren from

class are to be placed tyrants, who persecute the ministers
of the Gospel; heretics, who attack the doctrine of the

down as a principle, that it is of no consequence whether
a door be opened for true Religion or papistical supersti-
