Ver. 7. EplsTLE To THE coLossmNs. 269

undoubtedly makes the Colossians much more solicitous
about regulating their life properly, whilst he intimates
that he was so solicitous to know the same. There is no
doubt but even amon gst ourselves, all in whom there is the
least spark of shame and honesty, would live more holily,
if pastors, according to their office, would endeavour to
know the manners and course of life of individuals.

And comfort your bearis] This is the last cause whereby
Paul was impelled to send Tychicus. They needed conso-
lation in a twofold respect ε

1. Because, as it is very likely, they were much grieved
on account of Paul's being imprisoned, of whose death,
by the well known cruelty of Nero, who then ruled, they
could not but daily expect the sad tidings, Tyclficus,
therefore, relieves the minds of the Colossians, by relating “
to them that this eminent Apostle not only lived and was
well, but even preached the Gospel freely in his bonds„

2. They needed consolation in respect of their own in-
firmity: For it is too much the case to shrink from a pro-
fession of the Gospel through impending danger. For the
devil and the flesh, impatient of the cross, are wont to
suggest to the minds of men, that it is folly to embrace
that doctrine which kings endeavour to extirpate by
punishment, which the wise men of the world endeavour
to subvert by various schemes. The Apostle, therefore, in
order to meet this evil, and confirm them in the saith
against persecutors and against seducers, sent Tychicus to
establish them, and exhort them that they should not be
moved by these afflictione, but be ready after his example
to suffer any thing for the Gospel· See l Thess. iii. 2.

Hence we may learn,

l. To acknowledge the inbred evil of our nature,which
causes us all to be deJected in mind as often as we perceive
the cross and affliction to threaten the profession of the
Gospel : for we are as that stony ground, which receives the
word with joy, but when tribulation ariseclz for tlte word’s
sake isfortlzwith ffrzded, Matt. xiii. 20. Therefore, it be-
hoves us to withstand this evil, to lift up our hearts, and
to confirm them by spiritual comforts. For tlu's οιιν light
