562 CONTROVERSY AMONG THE FRENCH DlVlNES·

B.M. and as it appears to them of thefDeputies
from England and the Republic of Bremen at the
Synod of Dort.

There are, “lon the other hand, those who dewy that
Christ diedfor all men individually, with the intention
os saving them, and that Gocl really wills tlzat all men
individually should be saved. They wish that the
opinion of the Deputies from England and Bremen
on this subject should be rejected by the Synod
of Dort, or referred to an opposite Synod : and
think the opinion of Cameron and his disciples

as pure Arminfflnism, a hydra of errors, opposed
to the Synod of Dort, a subversion of the nature

of the Divine law, of the Gospel‚ of the necessity

by the minister of that city was appointed to teach the learned languages at
Bergeron. He was subsequently appointed Professor of Philosophy at
Sedan, and after remaining in that capacity two years, returned to Bour-
deux, and engaged in the study of Divinity. In 1608 he assumed the of-
fice of Blinister in that town, and then accepted of the Divinity Chair at
Saumur, where he continued until the dispersion of that academy in 1621.
He then removed to England, and was made by King James Master of the
Colleges and Divinity Professor at Glasgow 3 but found the appointment so
disagreeable, that he returned to France, where the disputes between the
two religions were now bringing on a civil war. Cameren, whose princi-
ples disinclined him to violence, having opposed the emissaries of the Duke
de Rohan, who endeavoured to induce the people of Montauban to take
arms, was attacked by a zealot of the party in the streets, and severely
beaten; and such was the effect upon his mind and body, that he died soon
after, aged 46, According to Bayle, he was a man of great parts and learn-
ing, but insufferably long-winded and vain. He was the author of an at-
tempt to reconcile the doctrine of predestination with a more consoling
notion of the Divinejustice and benevolence, a theory which was more fully
developed in the ‘⁶ System of Universal Grace,'’ by his disciple Amyraut,
but which Mosheim says, after examination, he was persuaded was no
more than Arminianism or Pelagianism artfully dressed up, and ingeniously
covered with a half-transparent veil of specious, but ambiguous expressions.
Cameron's Theological Lectures are printed in three Vols. cito. Saumur, and
in one Vol. folio, Geneva.
