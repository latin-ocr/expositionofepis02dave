more than that the offering and acceptance wasjoined with
an absolute purpose of saving those for whom it was of-
fered and accepted in this manner. Malderus, Bishop of
Antwerp, relying on this argument, rejects the contrary
opinion of those who think that Christ died for all equally
as to the efficacy of his death, and concludes thus (page
1370* Predestz‘nation being supposed, it follow& that Christ
conferred by his death nmch more οη these predestinatecl per-
sons than οη others.

position which is to be retained between the offering of
Christ for men, and his prayer or intercession for thern.
That Christ prayed or interceded with his Father for the
elect, that they might retain a firm and invincible faith to
the last, and might effectually obtain salvation, may be ¹
collected from John xvii„ and from his prayer offered for
Peter by name, that hissaith should notfail. And trulyshe
who should deny that the excellent gift of perseverance

of Christ, would refer the greatest of all spiritual benefits
to the acceptance of free-will. This being admitted, I

and Regius Professor in the University of Lonvain, was nominated Bishop
of Antwerp by the Governors of the Low Countries, and on the 7th of
August, 1611, took possession of his See, over which he presided 22 years,
and died at Antwerp, Oct. 21st, 1633. He is said to have been a man of
singular modesty and learning. Besides treatises on Confession, and on the
abuses of Mental Restrictions, he wrote, what he called, a Refutation of
the Synod of Dort, (vide p. 527) a Commentary on the Song of Solomon,
Theological Meditations, and several Volumes of Commentaries on the
Summa of Thomas Aquinas. (Richard ct Giraud, Bibliotlze‘que Sam-ge, tom
