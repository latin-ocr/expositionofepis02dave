356 A DlSSERTATlON on THE DEATH or cneis'r,

in his judgment of the second article of the Remonstrants,
which he transmitted to the Synod of Dort, has these

ordained that Christ the Mediator should sustain the wrath π

of God due to the sins not of certain persons, but of the
whole human race, He willed that this passion of Christ
should be a remedy applicable to the human race, that is,

to which he replied. In this year also appeared a “ Commentary of his on
the Epistle to the Romans,” which acquired great fame, and was speedily
dispersed all over Europe. This gave such offence to our King, James 1.,
by doctrines promulgated in it supposed to militate against regal preroga-
tives, that he ordered it to be burnt publicly in London by the common
hangman. ln 1619, Pareus, at the instance of the States-General, was
pressed to go to the Synod of Dort3 but he excused himself from becom-
ing a deputy on account of his age and infirmitie53 though he wrote to the
Synod his judgment on topics in dispute- He was very averse to all inno-
vations in points of doctrine. He would not suffer any man to deviate a
tittle from the Catechism of Ursinus, relative to Justification, and strenu-
ously resisted, like a brave champion for the established doctrine, altera-
tions in the Catechism of Heidelberg. These innovations, he alleged, were
a removal of the boundaries of truth, which ought to be sacred and im-
moveable. He even maintained that the humour of innovating foreboded
an approaching ruin to the Church. He used to say with Luther, From a
vain-glorious toacher, a litigious pastor, aud useless questions, deliver thy Clzurch,
Good Lord! He was a great advocate for peace3 and though he enjoyed
little in his latter days, being obliged to flee from Heidelburg on account of
the reverses that took place there, he yet returned, resolved to fetch his
last breath in a beloved retreat he had formed at it; and dying in peace at
his Pal-eanum in 1622, he was interred with all the honours his College

could bestow on his memory.

Of Pareus's Opera Exegetica, 4 vols. folio, 1647, Mr. Bickersteth in his
“ Christian Student” observes :—“ Have too much of what is valuable to
be omitted in this list.‘’
