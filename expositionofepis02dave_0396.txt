386 A DISSERTATION oN THE DEATH or cuaisr.

believed not had the death of the Son of God applicable
to themselves, although they had it not applied, because
they believed not. And on this account the elect alone
find life in the death of Christ, because they alone believe
in God, who has compassion upon them.

OBJECTION 11. The death of Christ is not applicable
to those for whom he did not die, or was not offered up.
But there are numberless persons for whom he did not die,
or was not offered up, nainely, all those who were not
written in the book of life of the elect, before the founda-
tion of the world. From thence they endeavour to con-
firm the minor, that the Apostle broadly asserts that God
would freely give all things to those for whom the Son died,
Romans viii.32, He that spared not his own Son, but deli-

only of men, but of fallen angels, yet, on account of the
want of its ordination and acceptation as to angels, we>
deny that Christ ought to be said to have died for them in
any way. The same thing might also be declared respect-
ing men, if there were any alienated and exeluded from all
possibility of the aforesaid redemption on account of the
same want of Divine ordination and acceptation. But as
it was said, the major being granted, let us proceed to the
minor. I answer therefore, That there is no one who is a
partaker of the same human nature which the Redeemer
deigned to assume, for whom Christ did not deliver up
himself as a price of redemption, applicable according to·-
