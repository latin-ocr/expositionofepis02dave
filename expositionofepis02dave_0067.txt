the condemned fisced in hell than the blessed iu heaven—So far
concerning the cause of the Divine wrath, and the out-
pouring of the same.

Upmrthe children eff disobedience] The quality of the
persons subjeeted to this Divine wrath, is described in
these words. In the Greek it is ἐπὶ τοῦς ὑιοῦς v? ς ἀπειθείας,
Some translate these words, upon the children of distr-ast, 01·
incredulz'ty ,- others, upon the intrat-table, or disobedient chil-
dren. All these come to the same point3 and denote men
of that kind who can by no means be persuaded to believe
the Divine word, and renounce their sins. In this term
'avt-eiSec'ccg, therefore, two crimes are involve63 one of unbe-
lief, the other of disobedience; this latter is the genuine
offspring of the former. Such were those wholived before
the flood in the days of Noah3 whom Peter, l Epis. iii. '
20, calls the ἰησνεᾱιιῖοιικἠὲ who, as Christ sayS‚ did in se-
curity, eac, drink, marry, and knew not until the stood came
med took them all away, Matt. xxiv, 38, 39. Such were the
people of Sodom and Gomorrha, who would not believe at
the preaching of Lot, but, as though he spake in mockery,
slighted him, Gen. xix. 14. Finally, such are all the re-
probate, to whom that saying of the prophet Zechariah
vii. ll, well applies, But they refused to hearlcen, and pulled
away the shoulder‚ and stopped their ears, that they should not
hear. It is plain, therefore, that the reprobate and blinded
are described in this place: For although the elect may be
disobedieut for a time, yet they are not the children of dis-
obedience upon whom the wruth of God cometh; because,
being softened by the effectual operation of Divine grace,
they at length yield3 as we may perceive in all the exarn-
ples of the godly who have fallen.

ssut here it may be doubted, what the Apostle meant,
when he said, for these sins, viz.f0rnication, uncleamzess, &Q
the wrath of God cometlz upon the children <ff disobedience.
Does it not also come upon the children of God? Who is
ignorant that David felt the arrows of Divine wrath for

’ἔ Incredulous in the Vulgate3 disobedient in our version, more consis-
tently with the original.
