364 A DlSSERTATloN οΝ 'rna DEATH oF cuium,

8. The last argument is taken from a comparison of
the twofold covenant, and according to it, of a twofold
ordination of men to salvation. As, therefore, in the co-
venant of nature, that is, the agreement with Adam at the
time of creation‚ salvation was procurable by Adam and
all his posterity under the condition of obedience to be
paid to the law of nature, and to the express command-
ment of G0d; so in the covenant of grace, which was con-
firmed by the blood of the Mediator, salvation is also un-
derstood to be procurable for all men under the condition
published in the Gospel, that is, of faith in this Mediator,
who hath made satisfaction for the sins of the human race.
Moreover, as in the first covenant, God, who ordained
salvation as procurable for Adam and his posterity, yet
did not predestinate that either Adam himself or any of
his posterity should be really saved by that covenant3 so
God, who in the second covenant ordained salvation as
procurable for all under the condition of saith, yet hath
not predestinated to give to all men individually this saith,
by which they might infallibly obtain salvation. But lest
the blood of the Son of God should flovv, and through
the fault of the human will the same should happen
in the second covenant which had happened in the
first, namely, that no one should enjoy the benefit of it,
God resolved with himself a more deep and secret counsel,
and determined of his mere and special mercy to give to
some persons the ability and will to fulfil the aforesaid
condition of faith, and further, that they should actually
and infallibly fulfil it. But now, as he would be unjust
towards God who should deny that salvation was ordained
by God as procurable for Adam and his posterity under the
covenant of nature3 so heis more unjust towards Christ,
who denies that his death was ordained by God, as a re-
medy for salvation applicable to all under the condition of
the new covenant, although many do not obtain salvation
by means of it. God himself gave to the world this re-
medy applicable to all mankind individually ; let the world
concede to God the liberty of applying it, as it may seem
