sum of our salvation to depend upon the grace of God
alone, he was wont to begin his Epistles with this same
prayer, as well as to conclude them by it, as I'fsorlffyissg
thefuilhsul οη every side by the wall of Dz'vine grace, as says
Chrysostom. Now by grace lie understands the paternal
favour of God accepting us in Christ the Mediator, and all
spiritual blessings which are used to flow to us from this
favour of God. Therefore, in this single word grace is
contained that great fund of blessings which are promised
to believers and exhibited in the Gospel.·

That last word Amen, is derived, as is known, from the
Hebrevv word A ΜΛΝ, which in Hiphil signifies to beliac&
in Niphal signifies to befirm, stable,faitl1sul. It is there-
fore a particle of confirmation and certification ς and when
it is altaclzzd to α pra-iser, it is as z't were ils seul, as Jeronie
observes. By this word, then, the Apostle shews the cer-
tain persuasion of his beart, that God would hear this his
prayer, ancl bestow his grace abundantly upon them. Thus
it behoves us to repose a sure saith in God, as often as We
seek any thing· from him, especially when we desire to ob-
tain the gifts of saving grace3 which, by seeking faithfully
from God the Father for his S‘on's sake, shall be bestowed
upon us by the Holy spirit copiously and freely.
