Clmp. v. THE TuiRD PRoPosiTioN s‘rATizo, ἃς. 471

Repu. If by reconciliation nothing else is meant than
the inclination and propensity of the Divine will to grant
remission, and make peace with all who shall embrace the
Recleenier by saith, we grant that God is reconciled to the
whole human race, by virtue of the death of Christ, even
while we continue enemies to him. But herein (as was
stated before) a step is taken towards our actual and per-
sonal reconciliation, rather than the actual reconciliation
of individuals is effected. Moreover, if by reconciliation
we understand the eternal election of God, according to
which he hath determined to call,justify‚ reconcile to him-
self, and save certain individuals in time, you cannot by
this means make it out that God can in this sense be said
to be benevolent to all the elect, even when they are living
in impiety and unbelief. But this benevolence which pre- ⁸
cedes faith inspired into the hearts of the elect, contains
only a purpose of making peace with them, and does not
place them in a state of peace obtained and of actual re-
conciliation. These things being premised, Ireply, that
all these passages speak either of the step towards personal
reconciliation, or of the elect believing and being placed
in a state of actual reconciliati0n3 which cannot take place
without the intervention of saith. They therefore confirm
our opinion, rather than the opposite. For that which is
said Rom. v. 10, leen we were enemies, we were reconciled to
God by the death of his Son, διο. has no other sense than
that men, from a state of emnity, are transferred into a state
of actual reconciliation with God, through the death of
Christ, as soon as they believe in Christ. This is plain,
because the Apostle, verse l of this chapter, restrains this
peace or reconciliation to those only who arejustffied hy
jaitlz ; and verse 11 he speaks of the same actual reconci-
liation as being just made, By ‘colzom tce leave now received
the atonement, (margin) or reconciliation, that is, now, after
we have believed in Christ. With respect to the second
passage, Ephes. ii. 4, 5, it is most true, that God, when
we were dead in sins, hatlz quiclcened us together with Christ,
but as he hath not actually quickened any unless by faith
previously inspired, so neither hath he reconciled them3
