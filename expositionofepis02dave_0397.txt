the ordination and aeceptation of God, for remissior] of
sins, to be obtained by faith in his blood. Nor does the
Apostle contradict us, whose whole discourse in Romans
viii. is not designed to console any description of persons
in anycondition, but the elect; nor the elect merely as
such, but the elect now called, justified, sanctified, that
is, as he says Coloss. i. 13, now deliveredfrom the power ff
darkness, and translated into the kingdom of his dem· Son,
Nor does he simply and universally affirm that God freely
gives all things to all men for whom Christ died, but to all
of us to whom the present discourse relates, that is, to all
the predestinated who are believing in Christ, for whom
not only Christ died, but to whom moreover Christ is now
given in an especial manner, that is, is united and com-
municated with the infinite treasure of his merits. There-
fore this consolatory argument of the Apostle derived from
the death of Christ is efficacioris3 but only if it is accom-
modated to those persons to whom it was accommodated
by the Apostle, and only so far as it was accommodated by
him, namely, in this manner, Thon, whosrom thy effectual
calling, justificatior), and sanctificalz'on, canst now know and
perceive that thou art predestinaled, ancl that for thy special
and effeclual redemption, Gocl willed not only that leis Son
should be offered up lo lzz‘msels, bnt also communicacecl to thee ,-
why ranst tlzon not lrnst him with llze rest, that lze will freely
give thee all other things necessary to accomplislz thy salvation ?
But if any one desires to apply the aforesaid reasoning to
any persons whatsoever setting aside the consideration of
predestinationi, calling, and justification‚ in this manner,
Christ diedsor you, ον Christ gave himsegf a ransom or sacri-
fice to God lo expiate your sins, and therefore God zcz‘llsreely
give you all things, I say, that he extends this argument be-
yond its limits, contrary to-the mind of the Apostle, who
confined it to certain persons, namely, the predestinated‚
and to them as placed in a certain condition, namely‚ of
justification and adoption.
