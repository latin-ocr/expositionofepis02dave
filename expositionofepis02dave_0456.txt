of God is bestowed upon those that believe, will desire and
knoclc without the grace of God, and does not consess that it is
through. the Divine power that we believe and will, by the in u-
sion and inspiration of the Holy Spirit in us, he opposes the
saying of the Apostle, Bv THE GRACE oe Gon I AM
wnAT Ι ΑΜ. So much for the first part of our proposi-
tion3 Icome now to the other, which is framed in this
manner:

The death of Christ, considered asthe.ge71eral cause of the
salvation (ff mankind, delz'vers no one among adulas from the
guilt aud punishment of their sins ; makes ηο one actually re-
conciled to G0d; in one word, places no one in a state of grace
and salvacion before they believe the Gospel. For the expla-
nation of this proposition, Ι will promise these few
things :

The first is, Tlmt by the death of Christ, generally consi-
dered as the cause (ff the salvation of mankind, we mean
nothing more than the consideration of our Lord's passion
in its immediate effect, which it produces of itself, with-
out any concurrence of human actions. We affirm that
the immediate effect which is produced, without any thing
requisite on our part, is reconciliability, which is brought
into action as soon as we believe3 but not actual reconci-
liation, or being placed in a state of adoption aud salva-
tion, before we believe.

Another thing which we think should be premised, refers
to some difference to be observed in this matter between
adults and infants. For it was said, that none among adults
is reconciled to God, or deliveredfrom the gnilt of his sins with-
out tlte act offaith; (which will be proved hereafter).
From whence it is evident‚ that we admit that some among
infants are, by virtue of the death of Christ, absolved from

in consequence of its being understood that there were some persons in the
place who held sentiments not in unison with the orthodox saith. The

Council drew up 8 articles concerning grace, confirmed by passages of Scrip-
ture and a Collection of some sentences out of the F athers. The articles

were not only signed by the Bishops present, but also by Liberius the
founder of the Church‚ and other persons of distinction.-Vide Du Pin.
