Ver. 20. EPlsTLE To THE comssmus, 181

whom Jerome writes, betook herself to a monastery against
the consent of her parents, or could do so without viola-
ting filial duty ε upon which the hinge of the controversy
turns. Jerome says,sor not carz'ng to have sorsalcen ,your mo-
ther in 'order to live in a monastery ; buthe does not add, against
her will and consent; nay, he plainly asserts, that the virgin
was consecrated by the will of her mother, and he exhorts
her by this argument to avoid the suspected company of
some young man or other, and that she would live with
her mother, provided she was unwilling for her to remain
ln a monastery.

Ambrose, says Bellarmin, in 3. De virginibus, speaking of
those who prefess ic against the consent (ff their parents, does
not reprove them, but their parents, who endeavoured to pre-
vent their profession, whom he declares to be worse than Gen⁴
tiles. In proof of which he adduces these words of Am-
brose; There (that is, among the Gentiles) they are zpith-
drawnfrom marriage by reu-ards ; shall they he here compelled
to marry by injuries? there it is made violence to salse them
away,- shall violence be done to them here lest they enler upon
it? δίε.

What Bellarmin premises of his own is false, that Am-
brose spake of those virgins who offered of themselves
against the will of their parents, and reproved their pa-
rents, not them. For Ambrose speaks of a certain father
who had vowed the virginity of his daughter3 which pa-
ternal vow when the daughter wished to fulfil, and to pro-
fess her virginity according to the ceremonies customary at
that time in the churcli, a certain lover, by the favour of
her mother (as we may conjecture) sought to marry the
damseL and hindered her profession by force. Ambrose,
therefore, interposed his authority3 he pronounced it not
lawful for any one to compel this virgin to marry against
her will, devoted to God by her father, as well as by her
own consent. Therefore Bellarmin shews nothing else
from this place, than that it was not lawful to compel a
virgin to marry by force; which we may concede, without
any injury to our defenee.
