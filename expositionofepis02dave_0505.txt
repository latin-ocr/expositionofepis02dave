Sec. Afterwards he adds, He does nol prevent with his help
all who z‘mpede grace, bnt some, in whom lle clzooses to slzew ln's
mer-cy, af in otlzers the order of justice εἷς manifesled. At
length, lest we should refer it to the difference of human
wills, that some obtain efficacious grace aud are converted,
and others do not obtain it and romain unconverted, he
subjoins these words most worthy of observation, Since
God, from among ilie men who are held nuder tlte same sins, by
his preventing grace converts some, but endnres others, or per-
mits them to go on according to tlte order os things, tlze reason
is noc eo be songht why he converts some and not others; for
this depends on lzc's simple will, in llic same manner as ic pro-
ceededfrorn ln's simple will, that when lze made ‚all things of
nothing, some things were made more hononrctble than others. '
Such is the opinion of Thomas Aquinas. Therefore there
is not any Divine decree established by the death of Christ
concerning grace being administered promiscuously to all
men, as it were, with this condition annexed‚ that indivi-
duals should become partakers or not of this grace, as
they should put obstacles in the way or not3 but the dif-
ference between those that place an obstacle in the way,
and those who do not, is to be resolved into the mere good
pleasure of God, as the primary and radical cause.
ARGUMENT 7. If the will of God, through the death
of Christ, be understood as determined to administer
grace to all men individually, by which they may apply
Christ to themselves and be saved ; yet SO‚ that those only
receive and possess grace who have either made a good
use of the light of nature, or have not opposed an obstacle
to the grace which is offered to them, and all others do not
receive grace, then the ultimate reason of obtaining or not
obtaining grace and salvation‚ would not be attributed to
the good pleasure of God, but to human free-will. The
consequence is clear and strong-3 because by those who
are of this opinion, God is presumed, on account of the
death of Christ, to administer and offer to all meu grace
sufficient to apply Christ to themselves and to obtain sal-
vation 3 heis also presumed not to give saving grace to any
