cation remaining. Therefore this consequence is faulty3
viz. The death of Christ was not applicable to the damned
after their condemnation3 Therefore it was never and in no
way applicable to them.

OssJiscmoN 2. Those who say that the death of Christ
is applfflable, from the ordination of God, to every indi-
vidual, at the same time affirm, that God has provided for
many persons a remedy, which he foresaw would never
profit them. For God knew that none of the reprobate
would be healed by the medicine of the blood of Christ,
and delivered from eternal death. To what purpose there-
fore would he ordain so precious a remedy to be appli-
cable even to those to whom it was most certain that it
would never be applied ?

REPLY 2. You cannot on that account infer, that it⁴
rightly follows from our opinion, that this remedy, even
by the ordination and appointment of God himself, is ap—
plicable to innumerable persons to whom it will never be
actually applied. I deny‚ therefore, that any thing false
or inconvenient can be deduced from thence, although
this be granted. Yea, it is evident, that many benefits
have been provided by God for angels and men, I may

excellent gifts, which were conferred upon the apostate
angels in their first creation, were duly ordained by God
to produce in them firm and constant obedience, and to
secure their blessedness3 yet God knew that they would
be rebellious, and would never use those gifts to the ob-

same may be said of Adam in his state of uprightness,
whom God endued with knowledge and holiness‚ and
guarded with admonitions abundantly sufficient to preserve
him in his duty3 knowing at the same time that all these
things, which were applicable to the promotion of his obe-
dience and felicity‚ would never be applied. It is not
therefore foreign to Divine wisdom to appoint and ordain
means applicable to a certain end, although he may under-
