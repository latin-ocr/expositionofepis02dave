18 AN EXPOSITION or s'r. PAUL'S Clcap.iii.

Secondly, when the Apostle reasons, Ye are dead, there-
foreye ought to savour earthly things, an argument is dedu-
oed by a simile. For as bodily death severs men from all
commerce with earthly things, so this spiritual mortifica-
tion ought to estrange our minds from the study and de-
sire of earthly things. Bodily death of necessity wrests
men from all worldly concerns; spiritual mortification, by
a certain divine operation, withdraws us from the love of
these things : To be dead, then, means this, that they who
have the Holy Spirit mortifying within them the lusts of
the flesh, are able, by his assistance, to despise earthly
things, and desire those that are heavenly. Paul affords
a remarkable specimen of this, who was so much removed
from the desire of earthly glory, as to regard as dung what-
ever is desirable and glor-ioris in the eyes of the world.

Lastly, the Apostle’s conclusion is supported by what is
honourable and due. It is lzonourahle, that they who have
died sacramentally in baptism, should shew in their
life that they are really mortified. It is due, that they who
have vowed the mortification of the flesh in baptism, should
exercise the duty of mortification by a contempt of earthly
things. And thus ye see this consequence, Seelc not earthly
things, because με are dead, is most firmly sustained by
the force of many reasons. Now let us deduce some ob-
servations or doctrines.

1. A Christian serving the lusts of sin, is a deserter and
voluntary captive. For he is delivered from the service of
sin, this tyrant being weakened and smitten with a deadly
wound. See the miserable and shameful condition of these
in 2 Pet. ii. 19, 20: Of whom α man is overcome, of the
same is he brought in hondage. For if after they have es-
caped the pollutions qf' the world through the lchowledge of the
Lord and SaviourJesus Christ, they are again entang led there-
in, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the be-
ginning.

Q. There is no cause why a Christian should despond,
because he perceives in himself the rebellious motion of
sin, unless he obeys its lusts, and is himself drawn head-
long into rebellion. For, notwithstanding these eutice-
ments of sin, he who neither yields the consent of the will,
