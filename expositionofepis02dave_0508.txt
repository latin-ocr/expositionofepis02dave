itself, (De pecc. mer. δι rem. lib. i. 22) the Christian grace:
and Prosper calls it the grace of salvation, (De voc. Gent.
lib. ii. cap. 17) and in this sense he affirms that some na-
tions were living without the grace of God, (sentent. 10,
super Capit. Gallor.) namely, when they were living where
no one preached to them the Gospel of Christ. There are
also other supernatural gifts which place those who have
them in a state of salvation such as a good Will, Faith,
Conversion, Regeneration, and, in short, those which belong
only to men who are ingrafted into Christ and reconciled
to God. And these Augustine thinks are to be properly
called by the name of the grace os Christ. But the for-
mer, viz. the preaching and knowledge of Christian doc-
trine, he applies to this grace of Christ properly so called,
so far as they serve to produce and promote it. In his
book on the grace of Christ (Epist. 95, cap. 10, 47) he
professedly treats of it, so as to shew‚ that by this name
he means not the illumination of the mind and excitement
of the will, but saith itself and the gift of a good will.
This grace of Christ he paints in lively colours, and calls
it the grace whereby we are justified from iniquitis am] are
saved from itfirmitzs ,· the grace which we have not in common
with the zvz'clced, bat that whereby we hec-ome the sons of God.
Let us now attend to the testimonies of the Fathers.

First, we shall produce those which affirm that the grace
of the preaching of the Gospel, the death of Christ being·
supposed, is due or given to all men, yea, affirm that it is
denied to some, and that according to the purpose of the
Divine will, which would never be done, ifgrace were due
to all by the merit of the death of Christ. Augustine (de
bono persev. cap. 8) observes, Of two wz’clsed men of adult
age, why one is so called, that he should ohey the call, ancl cmo-
ther z's either not called at all, or not effectually, is to be refer-
red to the inscrutable juclgmenls <ff God. Here he plainly
acknowledges that some are not called at all. And (cap.
14) he teaches‚ that to some who by the supremejudgment of
God ore 1108 separatedfrom the mass of perdition, those means
are not granted by which they might believe. In both of these
passages he asserts the denial of means, and refers to the
