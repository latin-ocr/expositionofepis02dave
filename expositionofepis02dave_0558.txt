548 A DlSSERTATlON on THE nm'ru or cumsr,

Calvin, on Heb. ii. 13, at the words, Behold‚ I and the
children which God laath given me, says, Christ brings none to
tlze Father, but those whom He bach given him. But we lcnow
that this giving depends on eternal election ; because those whom
the Father hatlz destined to life, lze delivers into the custody (ff
the Son, that he may preserve them in sufetis. Three things
are here to be observed;first‚ That God the Father hath
specially destined some to life by the decree of election ε
secoudly, That Christ the Mediator hath received these elect
persons as peculiarly commended to him by the Father:
tlzirdty, That Christ takes special care of these elect per-
sons, and so defends and governs them in this life, that at
length he may lead them to life eternal. Which things
being granted, he would be destitute both of reason and
religion who should deny that Christ, in the work of his
oblation and of human redemption, intended the salvation
of these persons with a peculiar, that is, with an absolute
and effectual will. Zanchius (in Miscell. tract. de praed.
Sanct. p. 14) observes, It is notfalse that Christ diedfor all

But he died ffectuallyfor the elect alone, because indeed they
only are made partalcers of the cffcacy of the passion cffClzrist.
But that they only are made partakers effectually of this
passion, is to be referred to the special and effectual will
of Christ in suffering, and of God the Father in accepting
this sacrifice in a peculiar way for the elect more than for
others: for in the participation of saving good, the will of
God precedes the human will. Lastly, that l may not be
tedious in bringing together many authors, Vorstius* him-

* Vonsrms (Conrad), an eminent Divine of the Arminian sect, born
at Cologne in 1569, was the son of a dyer with a numerous family, who se-
cretly seceded to the Protestant Communion. conrad, who was destined
to a literary life, after passing five years at a village grammar-school, was
entered, in 1587, at the College of St. Lawrence, at Cologne‚ which he
quitted without taking a degree, but was subsequently sent to Haerlem and
Heidelburgh, at which University he was created a Doctor of Divinity.
After visiting the Academies of Switzerland, and giving lectures on theo-
logy at Geneva, in 1596, he accepted the Professorship of the latter faculty
at Steinfurt, where he also officiated as Minister until 1610, when he re-
ceived a call to succeed Arminius in the professorship of Theology at Ley-
