Bellarmin here adds two testimonies from the most noted
of the Fathers.

One is of Basil3 who checked the steward of the Em-
peror's kitchen, impertinently prating about dogmas of

not to serve up Divine eloquence.

l answer3 He did not recal him by the rebuke from the

commends every way the study and the reading of the
Scriptures by the laity, and on this very passage of the
Apostle which we have now under consideration, he thus
writes3 [t is llere slzewn that tlte lnily ought not only to possess
