That no benefit of redemption comes from the incarnation
and passion of Christ to any individual, until he relieves
in Christ. For Ambrose would not deny that Christ de-
scended and suffered for men, whether they believe or not;
buthe wishes to teach, that the benefit or saving virtue of
this passion, quickens and reconciles men when they be-
lieve. Therefore in this form of speaking he follows the
known rules of lawyers, who say, That not to be, and to be
uselessly, are to be rechoned as equal. Those things which
are found to be without effect, may be said to stand jor
nothing. Christ, therefore, is denied to have been incar-
nate and to have died for those who do not believe, be-

opinion of Ambrose, Isthou dost not believe, he descended not
for thee, he suffered not for thee. For the phrase, tlzey are
strangers to redemption, means nothing more than that those
who have not yet believed, are not partakers of remission
of sins and reconciliationi with God. So also the property
of redemption denotes the benefit of redemption acquired
and as it, were possessed, and declares that it belongs only
to those who believe and are regenerate. And lastly‚ those
words of Augustine, if z't is not interually received, ic does
not profit, plainly evince that the beneflt which redounds
from the death. of Christ is not derived to individuals, ex-
