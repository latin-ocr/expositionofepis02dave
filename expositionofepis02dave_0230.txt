220 AN EXPOSITION or ST. PAUL's Clzap. iv.

2. But those are here to be blamed who offend on
either side against that rule of justice which we have de-
scribed from the beginning. Many think that they are
provident and frugal, whilst they tame their servants with
labours and stripes, and wear them out with hunger and
fastings: Some, on the other hand, boast of their kind-
ness for their servants, because they permit them to run
abroad in idleness, and to waste their days in drunken
banquetings. But neither practise that which z‘sjust.

From the precept of giving that which is equas,

l. A Christian master ought not only to consider what
is the law or custom of humanity, but above all, what cha-
rity and Christian usage enjoin him to give his servants.
lf he shall not have performed the former, he acts unjustly
even according to the judgment of men3 if he has not
discharged the latter, he acts wickedly and oruelly in the
sight of God.

2. The law of analogy, or equis-y, ought to prevail
among all orders of men: and whatever superiors require
from their dependants, they ought, equally, if not in kind,
yet in analogy, to compensate the same. Thus much as to
the precept.

Ix‘nowz'ng that με also have α Master in heaven.] Here he
adds the inducement to the observance of the precept.
And this is twofold: One consists in this, that they should
know that they also have a Master3 lcnowing' that ye also
have α [Master. The other, that they should know· what
manner of Master they have—in heaven.

Knozvz‘ng tltatye also hare α Master] i. e. Holding, believ-
ἴῃς, considering that ye likewise and your servants are sub-
ject to a Master. This consideration is a sharp stimulus
to renderjustice and equity to servants, because it strikes
at injustice and iniquity. For on this account it is mas-
ters think to do what they please with servants, because

Negro, had not been brought to light. In a word, the subject of West
Indian Slavery had not been investigated; the wrongs of an injured mass
ofliuman beings, as existing in the British Colonies, and the claims ofjuslz'ce
and equity on their behalf, had not come underconsideration, nor been echoed
through a land of professing Christians.
