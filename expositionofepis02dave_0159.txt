ance of which we dare not implore the aid of Christ, and
which we do notjudge to be pleasing and acceptable to
God for Christ's sake, at least not to be displeasing and
abominable. Let the avaricious‚ the lustful, the drunken,
and indeed all the wicked, hence judge of their actions.

4. We should not attempt even good actions reiying
upon our own strength, but testing upon Divine aid, and
the mediation of Christ.

5. They abuse the name of Christ, who employ it for
those things which tend to the repro-sich, not to the glory
of Christ. Here the Papists sin grievously‚ who are wont
to exercise all their superstitious, to obtrude all their er-
rors in the name of Christ3 they are not much unlike those
indeed, who assume the name of Christ when they do the

1. As to the first3 Thanks are to be given both in the
using of the creatures and in the success and issue of all
things. The enjoyinent of the creatures requires thanks
from us as a debt3 otherwise we are inferior to the brute
animals. Hence that remark of the Apostle, 1 Tim. iv. 4,
Every creature of God is good, [md nothing to be rejected, ff
z't be received witlz tlzcmlcsgiving. Moreover in every success
and issue of things, aud every action of 01113, thanks are
to be given ; because all things ‹zo-operate sor good to those,
who undertake lawfui and honest things by invoking the
name of Christ. On this account, in Ephes. v. 20, he more
