Ver. l· EPISTLE TO THE COLOSSIANS· 9

have said, set your affections on things above, without its
being added, and not on things ofthe earth. But that saying
of the Saviour is true, No man can serve two masters, Matt.
vi. 24. If, therefore, we be slaves to our earthly desires,
we shall never be watchful to promote our salvation. The
poet heretofore sang, Om- bosoms do not admit two cares ; and
the Apostle said, foolz'sh aad hurtful lusts drown men in per-
dition, 1 Tim. vi. 9.

2. We must observe, that Paul forbids us to seek and
savour earthly things, he does not forbid us to use earthly
things, much less, indeed, to obtain them. We cannot
live without the use of earthly things3 but they would not
serve for necessary uses, unless they were before acquired.
Therefore, to seclc and affeci? them, means in this place, to

desire them with the whole heart, with every labour and'4 '

industry : and to acquiesce in those things as in the great-
est good. This carnal and worldly men do, whatever they
pretend: this is evinced by their coveting these earthly
things in every way and without measure. Now it is plain,
that that is sought and proposed as their sole end, which
is sought immeasurably : for in that which is sought on ac-
count of some end, a measure is admitted in proportion to
the end.

3. We may add a reason why it is not fit to affect
earthly things, but those alone which are above3 and that
twofold, One taken from the vanity of these things3 for
earthly things, as Parisiensis has well remarked, cannot im-
part satisfaction to him that hatlz them, nor support lo him
that rests upon them, nor profit to him who labom'sfor them.
What then shall it prcfit a man if he shall gain the whole
world, Sec. Matt. xvi. 26. The other from their contrariety
to true and heavenly pleasures. For, as the heavenly man-
na failed after the children of‘Israel had eaten of the fruits
of the earth; so the sweetness of spiritual pleasure is not
perceived by those who have a longing after these earthly
things. VVhence said Augustine‚ If the mind hath delight
from what is external, it will remain without deligat from what
is internal. Thus much for the matter of the Apostle's ex-
hortation. Let us procecd to the inducements.
