men are restored to a state of grace and salvation‚ because
Christ died for mankind, arguments of this kind are pro-

in his Bibliotheca Theologica Selecta, Vol. ΙΙ. pp. 645-648, has given an
account of Huber's publications, and also of those by his antagonists; and
from this accurate Ecclesiastical Biographer we learn that Huber held the
following tenets:—

Deum omnes homines in Christo ad felicitatem sempiternam eligisse, nul-
la ratione habita fidei, sive ea praediti sint ; sive minus; eo tamen modo, ut
decreti hujus veluti mutatio fieret apud illos qui gratiam Divinam adsper-
narentur. Cum errore hoc alia prava dogmata conjunxit, praesertim de re-
generatione ac justificatione, utramque esse universalem: omnesque mor-
tales, pios atquesimpiOS, Turcas ac Christianos, propter universum Christi·
meritum ac per aequitatem, veniam peccatorum consequi posse. Walch.
Bibl. Theol. Sel. Vol. 11. p. 645.

On two former occasions (vide p. 366 and p. 448) Bishop Davenant has
cited Puccius in conjunction with Huber. Pncans (Francesco Pucci or
F ranciscus Puccius) was descended from an antient Florentine family, and
was early distinguished for his love of study. From Lyons, whither he
had gone with the design of entering into commerce, and where he culti-
vated the Society of Literary men, he came into England, and went to
Oxford, where he studied Theology, and took the degree of M.A. in 1574·
His opposition to the Calvinist party (which at that time was dominant in
the University), in his Treatise De Fide in Deum, quoe et qualis sit, procured
him many enemies, and finally lost him a Professor's Chair. He then
withdrew to Bas1e‚ where he became acquainted with Faustus Socinus, to
whose opinions he was favourable. The Divinos of Basle forced him to quit
that city on account of his opinions respecting universal grace, which he
proposed in his Thesis entitled—Universum genus humanum in ipso utero qffi'..
caciter particeps esse beneficiorum Christi et vitoe immortalis et beaiae, ἃς. Pucci
expected to find more toleration at London ; but scarcely had he arrived
there when his extravagant opinions caused him to be thrown into prison.
On being liberated he fied into Holland‚ and corresponded with Faustus
Socinus, whom however he opposed, on certain pointS, in his treatise De
Immortalitate naturali primi hominis ante peccatum. After wandering about to
various places, in 1595 he held some conferences with the Papal Nuncio then
at Prague, and returned to the Romish Church. Some years before, he
had dedicated to Pope Clement VIII. a Treatise entitled De Christi Salva.
toris Efficacitate omnibus et singulis hominibus, quatenus homines sunt, Assertio
Catholica, &c. Pucci was subsequently ordained a Priest in the Romish
Church, and became Secretary to cardinal l'onipeyssid'Aragon, in whose
house he died in 1600. (Biographie Utzz'verselle. T om. XXXVl. pp. 281,
