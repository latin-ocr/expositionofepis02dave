(Rom. xi. 33,) In these words, by making some and noc others
his sheep, he means nothing more than making some faithful
and obedient, and not making others so. Both are attributed
to God, and that according to the purpose of his secret
will. Therefore there has not been established by the
death of Christ such a decree, as some have formed, for
preparing, offering, and giving to all men that grace by
which they may be rendered believing and obedient, under
the condition of free-will embracing it. A third testimony
is taken from (De Praed. Sanctor. cap. 9,) Faith, both in 1
‘its commencement and perfectiore, is the gift of Gocl. And
that this gift is granted to some and not to others, cannot be
doubted at all by any who do not wilfully oppose the most plain
words of Scriptures. But why it is not given to all, ought not
to stagger the believer, who believes that from one all are under
condemnation. He clearly teaches that the grace offaith is
not given to all3 and that there is no need of seeking any
reason why this grace is not given, since that damnable
state in which we were all born is sufficient to shew the
justice of God, even if he should not give the grace of
salvation to any mortal man. A fourth testimony is de-
rived from the book (De corrept. Sc Grat. cap. 5.) where
the unbelieving and rebellious are reproved in this man-
ner, I should be rightly blamed, if I had it not (that is, faith
and obedience) of my ownjaulc, that is, if Icouldgive it to
myself, or take it, and should not do so, or if Gocl should give
it and I should be unwilling to receive it. But when the very
will is prepared by the Lorcl, why do zsou blame me, &Q Au-
gustine answers in this manner, (cap. 6) The original depra-
vity through which God z's disobeyed, is of man, because by
falling, through his own evil will, from tlzat uprightness in
which Gocl at first made him, he became depraved. T het-<fore
the dam-noble origin should be blamed, that from the grief ορ
correction the will <ff regeneration may arise, if he who is cor-
rected is a child (ff promise, that God may by his secret inspi-
