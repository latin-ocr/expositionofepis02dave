formerly relying on this argument, boldly asserted, That
God could not possibly do any thing beside those things which
he has done, oris about to clo. (Wal. doct. fidei, Tom. 2,
lib. i. cap. 1.) If this should be true, since it is certain as
to the greater part of men, that God neither foreknew nor
decreed that saith should be produced in them, yet there is
no reason why we should say that this condition of saith is
possible in any way as to the non-elect, although they are
living in this world.

We reply, It is most true that God neither does nor per-
mits any thing, without his eternal decree and eterna] fore-
knowledge preceding. But if any one should from thence
conclude that God cannot. do any thing according to his
ordinary power, except those things which he hath fore-
known and decreed should be done, it is most false. For
as our Hales rightly says, (Part. l, qu. 21, art. 4, memb.
2) The Divine power is not linzited either by the ‘will or the
forelcnowledge of God, although. his forehnowledge and will
always accompany the manffestation of Divine power in ac-
tion. Aquinas gives the reason of this sufficiently plain,
(Part. l, qu. 25, art. 5, ad 1) namely, Because his act is
subject to the forehnowledge and ordination of the doer, but
not his ability to do that which z's according to nature. For
God does any thing, because he szl, but it is not because he
will, that therefore he is able to (Io it, but because he is able z'n
his own nature. Aquinas likewise answers the aforesaid
objection in form, (Quaest. disp. de potentia Dei, art. 5,
resp. ad ΓΜ) His words are as follows : This saying3
ΤΗΑΤ Gon CANNOT Do ANY THING BESlDEs WHAT HE
HATH FOREKNOWN THAT HE wourn Do, is twcfold; be-
cause the exceptive particle BESlDEs refers either to the power
which is denoted by the word CAN, ον to the act which is de-
noted by the word Do. If it is referred to the first of these,
the saying issalse; for Gocl can do more things than hefore-
knew that he would do. If to the second, then the meaning is,

tent of his erudition, the power of his rhetoric, and the bitterness of his
unhappy fate.” He is generally regarded as the author of the Scholastic
System which gave rise to so many subtleties in this age, and became so ser-
viceable to Rome.
