beart and mind. For this internal affection of love gives
the heart itself to the thing loved, which is the most pre-
cious and first gift, and that, in fine, in which all other
gifts are given when occasion requires: for love is diffusive
of its good. It is not badly said by Aristotle, Rhet. 2. 8,
Love is tlte wishing lo any] one wlzat it com-eines to be goodjot'
the sake (ff that one, and uotfor its own; and it is the endea-
vourz'ng to accomplz'slc this, cessar as it can. Therefore he re-
quires such an affection in the heart of the husband. But
because we cannot thrust our eyes into the hearts of men,
10 see the interna] affection, external effects are required
in testimony of love: for the proof of love is the exhibi-
tion of its operation. Let us come to this.

The love of the husband ought chiefly to express itself
in three effects.

First‚ it is shewn herein, that he lives freely and cheer-
fully with his wife in his own house3 hc is delighted
with her presence and company3 he suffers himself to be
torn from her for any long time only by necessary
causes, and then thinks himself to be cast elsewhere and
to be thrown hither and thither, and at home with his wife
to rest as in the wished-for haven. For although married
persons ought to be so prepared in mind, that, if it be ne-
cessary, the one can bear absence from the other with
equanimity3 yet it is not to be allowed that the husband
should hate or be weary of the company of his own wife,
or willingly be elsewhere than with lier3 for true love is
mostly delighted with the presence of the beloved, and is
tormented as it were by the absence of the same. This ef-
fect of love we see in Christ towards his Church: for he
never deserts her, or leaves her alone: but performs what
he promised Matt. xxviii. 20, I am witlc you always even
unio tlte end (gf tlte world. Thus, then, ought the husband
also to be animated towards his wife, to be with her con-
stantly unto the last breath of his life. This Solonion re-
quires from all pious and good husbands in Prov- v. 18, 19,
quoice with the wg'fe (ψ’ ΠΨ] youth. Let lter be as lllt’ lot-<ing
lzz'nd and pleasant roe ; let laer breasts satisfzs thee at all limes,
