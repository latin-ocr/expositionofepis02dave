predestination and free-will, and obliquely touches upon
the death of Christ, inasrnuch as the orthodox, assigning
a reason why it eventually brings salvation to some per-
sons, always ascend to the Divine predestination, the Pe-
lagians descend to the human will. Prosper, in his epis

tle to Augustffle, thus expresses their opinion in this mat-

Augustine contended in his books On the predestination of
the saints, and the benefit of perseverance. This error
also Prosper attacked in his poem On the ngratefu13 in
which he teaches from the opinion of the Pelagians, that

Yet the sanie Prosper says, that God by his predestinating
and operating will, would that those only should be re-
deemed to whom he should give those things, by means of
which they should be infallibly led to salvation. And,
lastly, he shews that this efficacious will of saving some
by the death of Christ and not saving others, did not flow
