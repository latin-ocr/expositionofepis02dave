are invited, expressed in this word, mortis-is, i. e. make the
body of the old Adam as a dead carcase3 that, although
it may retain certain members and lineaments, yet they are
inefficacious‚ being destitute of life and motion3 i. e. Let
not sin reign in your mortal body, tlzat με should obe-y it in
the lusts tlzeretff} Rom. vi. 12. This our mortification‚ there-
fore, is nothing else than the study and the practice of re-
pressing our corrupt nature, and restraining all unlawful
actions and affections which are wont to spring from thence.
But in this study these three things are involved : a serious
determination of resisting sin3 an avoiding of the occasions
which are wont to induce us to sin3 a careful use of all
means which tend to the subduing of sin. A good deter-
mination averts the heart itself from the ways of sin3 a di—
ligent avoiding of it causes us not to return to it3 the use
of means, that we should be constant in our determination,
and proceed happily.

But since the Apostle exhorts us to mortify our mem-
bers‚ it may here be asked, lst. Is mortificationi a human
work, or of the human will? The Apostle seems clearly
to assert it in this place: but the whole Scripture proclaims
our mortification and vivification to be the effects of the

Divine power alone, produced by the Holy spirit regener-
ating and inspiring new life into men. Which are born not
(ff blood, nor of the will of man, but of God, John i. 13.
We are his worlcmauship created in Christ Jesus meto good
worhs, Ephes. ii. lO. Rightly said Gerson, part. 3, God
not only quichens the dead in sins, but stirs up the affections of
the soal to α desirefor this quz'clcening. And Augustine, The
,freedom (ff the will does not prevail in those things which per-
taz'n to God, but only in the worlcs respecling the present lise,
Contra Pelag. hypognost. lib. 3.

W'e shall easily solve this difficulty, if we will consider
what sort of persons those were of whom the Apostle is
here speaking. For he is speaking not of the profane and
the dead in sins; but of christiam, i. e. those whom he
presumes to be regenerate: and he commands them to mor-
lg'fizs cheir nzemhers, &a Therefore, for the sake of perspi-
cuity, we must admit the existence of a twofold mortifica-
tion: First, that which we may call hahilem] or infernal,
