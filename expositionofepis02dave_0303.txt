Ver. 13. El‘tSTLE 'ro THE cotossmNs. 293

when occasion offers, to honour and commend by their
testimony, all those whom they perceive to have discharged
their ministry honestly and faithfully.

2. 'Po pay attention to ministers, that they may in
every way render clear and evident to all, that love and
care for the flock, by which they deserve so honourable a
testimony.

2. But now what was this testimony of Paul exhibited
to Epaphras? leat he harh α great zealfor you, &Q The
Greek word for zeal is derived from a word which signifies
to grow hot, or to boil up as water being heated is wont to
do. The Apostle therefore would intimate, that this love
in Epaphras was no languid and ordinary love, but a fer-
vent and vehement one, as well towards his Colossians,⁴
as also towards the Laodiceans and Hierapolitans their
neighbours.

As to these cities3 Pliny, Hist. Nat. lib. 5. c. 29, c'alls
Laodicea, α most celebrated city, and writes that it was εἰ·
τηαίεά upon the river Lycus, and formerly called Diospolis.
Hierapolis was near to this. In the year after the death
of Paul, historians write, that both Colosse and Laodicea
were destroyed by an earthquake. And for many ages
afterwards it appears that the whole country of Asia Mi-
nor, in which these Churches formerly flourished, was
seized and subverted by Mahometan superstition and
Turkish tyranny.

Corollaries.

1. The fervor of charity, and zeal for the salvation of
their brethren, ought to grow strong in all Christians, but
especially in ministers3 of this, Paul himself afforded an
illustrious example, Rom. ix. 3. For the coldness of love
shews the abounding of iniquity. Matt. xxiV. 12.

2. This love, and this desire of promotiug the salva·
tion of others, not only extends itself to that particular
Church in which we live, but to all those other Churches
of Christ, with which we are joined in the unity of the
saith and of the Spirit. What therefore Paul said through
apostolical authority, that every one may say from Chris-
tian charity, lee care of all the Churches comella upon me
