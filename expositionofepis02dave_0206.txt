196 ΑΝ EXPOSlTlON or ετ. PAUL'S Clzapstii,

Vers. 22, 23.

Servants, obey in all things your masters according lo the
fleslz ; vot witlz eye-service, as men-pleasers‚· bnt in sin-
gleness of lzeart. fearing Gocl :

And whalsoeverye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and
not unco men.

The duties of wives and husbands, of children and pa-
rents, have been explained: There remain these of ser-
vants and masters3 which being explained, nothing will be
wanting that pertains to domestic instruction. He begins
with servantS. As to what pertains then to these, the Apostle
does three things: 1. He gives a precept of obedience3
2. He teaches the mode of obeying; 3. He adds certain
stimuli, or incentives to obedience, vers. 24, 25.

In the first place the precept is to be explained, which
is contained in these words,

l. Servatum, obaz] in all things your masters according to
the Heslc] The occasion of this precept seems to spring
from the circumstance, that servants converted to Chris-
tianity, thought themselves to be exempt from the yoke of
servitude. Which opinion, full of error, the devii without
doubt instilled into the minds of men, that thence he
might render the Christian religion odious among the hea-
then, as a disturber of order. This error perhaps had
some colour3 lf masters embraced the Christian religion
together with their servants, it was unjust that they should
still hold them as slaves whom they were bound to account
as brethren: if Masters still adhered to paganism, when
then· servants were converted‚ it seemed much more unjust
that he who had been delivered and redeemed from the
power of the devil, should nevertheless remain in bondage
to a pagan man, who himself remained a slave to the
devil. These things seemed to have an air of probability3
