'Ver- 5· EPls'rLE ΤΟ THE COLOSSIANS· 39

It is not a crime (believe me) to corrupt a hoyo And lest any
one should say this was spoken in the person of Mitio, he
will find the same, according to Horace, to have been the
opinion of the rigid Cato3 who, when he observed a youth
entering a brothel, said, Hz'ther ic is right that-young men
should descend; as though that were an argument of probity
aud honesty. This opinion had taken deep root in the
minds of almost all the Heathen, that fornication was
either lawful, or at least to be tolerated. This error, therefore,
the Apostle in the first place meets, and asserts that forni-
cation should be utterly repelled by Christians; for if this
be proved, it easily follows, that other kinds of pleasure
which incur heavier guilt are much more to be avoided.

As to this vice3 1. We shall shew from the Holy Scrip-
tures how pernicious it is ε 2. We shall overturn those
excuses which are usually brought by the patrous of lust.
It will be manifest that this is indeed a heavy sin, if it be
weighed in the standard of the sanctuary. ’

l. Because it is always reckoned up, not among lawful
pleasures, but among the most loathsome and detestable
impurities. The Apossse, in Rom. i. 29, writes, that those
who are delivered to a reprobate mind are filled wz'tlr all zm-
rz‘glzteousness, fornication, wickedness‚ &c. And in Ephes. V.
3, Fornication and all uncleameess let it not be named among
you, δῖε.

2. Because they are judged to be excluded from the
intercourse of faithful Christians who follow fornication:
but no one is to be cast out of the Church for light errors.
We have this broad sentence of Paul against fornication,
1 Cor. v. 9, 11, l wrote unto you not to company wille forni-
cators: ff any man tlzat is called α brother be a fornicator, 850.
with suclz an one no not to eat.

3. Because for this crime ineu are excluded from the
kingdom of heaven, and are subjected to the Divine wrath
and indignation. 1 Cor. vi. 9, Nez'tlzerform'cators, πον islo-
laters, nor adfflterers, nor (stemmate, δίε. shall z‘nlzerit tlze
kingdom <ff Gocl. Audin Heb. xiii. 4, leoremovzgers and

adulteters Gocl shall jadge.
