affections: for so the word Βραβέυειν signifies. When, there-
fore, (as is often the case) the unruly affections of wrath,
hatred, and revenge rise in our hearts, this peace ‘ff God
ought to discharge its office, that is, put an end to the
contentions, as the umpire of the games, take away the
occasions thereof, compose their tumultuons affections,
and restore all things to peace.

But it is also to be noted, that the Apostle does not
simply direct that the peace qs God should ναῖε, but that it
