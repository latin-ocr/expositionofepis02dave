some corollarieS, as well for instruction as for correction,
and then finally for our consolation.
Instructions arising from this verse.

1. God will have Christ his Son to be the fountain and
the bestovver of this glorious life to all his faithful mem-
bers: it is, therefore, not to be hoped for or supplicated
from any others.

2. This Christ, being exalted to heaven, is removed
from our sight: he is therefore to be apprehended by the
eye of faith: and this ought to be the perpetual exercise

3. Nothing that is of any moment and worth can be
snatched from the pious man. Against our good things

(as they are called) of fortune, even against this frail life,
