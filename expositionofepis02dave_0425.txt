tradiction in those who admit a mere sufficiency of his
death as to all mankind, and deny its universal ordination
to procure salvation for all men. They are bound, there-
fore, to explode this distinction, which has been hitherto
approved by the orthodox, or to acknowledge with us the
ordained sufficiency of the death of Christ for the deliver-
ance of all. The very learned Pareus seems to be of this
opinion, when he affirms (Act. Syn. Dord. p. 213), That as
to the sufficienter) (ff his ransom and merit, Christ died and was
willing to die for each and every man. Here he does not
make the sufficiency consist in this only, that the death of
Christ was sufficient of its own intrinsic value to redeem
all, but also, in the will of Christ dying and ordaiuing his
death to be sufficient for the deliverance of all. And here
it is to be observed by the way, that they are deceived who ,
confine the death of Christ to the elect alone, so as to
conclude that he was willing to die for them only, and yet
pretend (Palatini Synod. Dord. p. 88) That tlzere is no qnes-
tion or contention concerm'ng the suffic-iency (ff the ransom of
Clzrislfor eaclz (md every man ,· bul all the controversy is re-
specting the efficacy (ff this ransom. Truly, granting the
sufficiency of the death of Christ in itself for the redemp-
tion of a thousand worlds, and granting also, that the ef·-
ficacy of this death is destined absolutely and infallibly,
not to all, but to certain persons actually to be delivered,
yet it still remains a matter of controversy, XVhether the
death of Christ is supposed to have an intrinsic sufficiency
for the redemption of all, under this hypothesis: If it
availed to offer and pay that ransom for all, and it had not
also joined to it the ordination of God, according to which
this ransom, sufficient. in itself, was actually offered for all,
and from thence is applicable and to be applied for salva-
tion to all, if they should be willing to obey the aforesaid
ordination and subject themselves to it. For such an or-
dination we contend, which regards even those who are
not saved, because tlzey leave not believed in the name of the
only begotten Son (ῃί God. And hence we say, That Christ
died for all men sufficiently. But here some of those who
eontend that Christ suffered and died for the elect alone,
