to mankind, that he will receive into favour any one who
should believe, without respect of persons, (which are
the very words of the Gospel) yet it does not from thence
follow, that this differe-:nce of believers and unbelievers‚ of
reconcile‘d and unreconciled, of saved and lost, is to be re-
ferred to the uncertain determination of the human will. For
he who promulgated this universal decree of the Gospel, he
that believetlz shall be saved, nevertheless hath reserved to
himself the special privilege of giving saith to some of his
special mercy, and of his not giving it to others of his
non-pleasure and on account of their manifest unworthi-
ness. By virtue of the death of Christ, God had bound
himself to be reconciled to every man who shall believe;
buthe hath not bound himself to bestow effectual grace
on every man, by which it should be infallibly effected ⁴
that he should believe. We therefore defend both these
things, namely, that God is so far pacified by the deathxof
Christ, that he is now ready to receive into favour any per-
sons whatsoever‚ if they repent and believe in Christ, and.
that the same God, who is ready on condition of faith to
grant the grace of remission equally to all men, yet has
not so provided, that he should conduct himself equally
towards all men, as to produce in them this condition of
faith. A merchant is said to be ready to sell his wares, if
any one is willing to buy them3 but that one should be
willing and another unwilling to buy them, is not caused
by the merchant, but depends on the will of each. The
matter is not so between God and us. For although, by
virtue of the death of Christ, he is now ready to give re-
mission, and to be reconciled to any man who will believe
in Christ, yet it is God's own peculiar prerogative to in-
spire into all who believe the will of believing. We do not,
therefore, join with the Semipelagians‚ but we say with the
Arausican fathers,²’“ (Can. 6) If any one says that the mercy

cil of Orange, held in the year 529, at the Dedication of the Church which
a Nobleman‚ and Praefect of the Gauls, had caused to be built in the city
of Orange, and at which Caesarius Bishop of Aries, and twelve other
Bishops were present. The Council which ensued on this occasion was held
