136 AN EXPOSlTlON oF ετ. PAUL's Clmp. iii.

and shewn to be altogether sophistical and nugatory: For
from the abuse of the Scriptures, they infer that the use
itself is to be denied to the people, in this manner,

l. Some of the laity, by reading the Scriptures, fall
into absurd heresies3 some into contempt of the Scrip-
tures3 some, either into contempt of the saints, or a per-
nicious imitation of them, when they read of their adul-
teries, lying‚ and things of that kind-z therefore, the laity
are to be restrained from the Scriptures.

If this kind of argument were good, God, Christ, and
the Apostles have sinned, who would have the word of
God proclaimed to all indiscriminately, notwithstanding
many abused them to their hurt, 2 Pet. iii. 16. Besides,
on this ground, the reading of the Scriptures should be de-
nied equally to the clergy and the laity: for they also oft-
times shamefully abuse the Scriptures. For who does not
know that almost all the heresies have sprung, not from
the laity and seculars, but from bishopS, presbyters, and
monks 22 We have almost as many testimonies, as names
of heretics. Lastly‚ the argument is ineonolusive3 many
laic-s lzave almsed tlze Scriptures, therefore they are to be taken
away-from. them indiscriminately: Let the abuse be taken
away; or at least, let the Scriptures be denied to those,

well versed, and strongly armed, in all the points of the Roman Catholic
Controversy. Bishop Hall was an almost enthusiastic admirer of him:
“ The honour of our schools (says he), and the angel of our chureh, learn-
ed WVhitaker, than whom our age saw nothing more memorable. What
clearnesse ofjudgment‚ what sweetness of style, what gravity of person,
what grace of carriage was in that mani tho ever saw him without re-
verence Ρ οι· heard him, without regard ?’' His works and his worth gained
him renown throughout Europe3 so that Cardinal Bellarmin, the champion
of Popery, though often foiled by his pen, honoured his picture with a place
in his Library3 and said, ‘³ He was the most learned heretic he had ever
read.'' His works were published collectively at Geneva, in 1610, in two
vols. folio ε but any of his pieces detached, when to be met with, are worth
the purchase to a person engaged in the study of the Romish Controversy.
It was Dr. VVhitaker who drew up the famous Lambeth Articles, intended
by Archbishop Whitgift, and several other Bishops and learned Divines as·
sembled at Lambeth, to settle some points then strenuously controverted
by one Barret, and Peter Baro. His answer to Campion is in Pope Bene-
dict's Index l‘rohibit.; bnt none of his other works.
