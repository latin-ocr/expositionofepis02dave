40 AN EXPOSIT10N oF s'r. PAUL’s Chapiii.

It is very easy to add many other reasons to these,
which may also demonstrate the weight of this crime.

4. Because it more especially pollutes the body than
other vices: but our bodies are ‘members (gf Christ and tem-
ples (ff the Holy Glmst‚ 1 Cor. vi. 15, διο. Itis, therefore,
no light crime to make the members of Christ members of

harlots, or to make the temple of the Holy spirit an abode
Of51.USt}·3ecause it peculiarly blinds the mind and under-

standing. The. wise Solomon, being blinded by this vice,
proceeded to idolatries3 Women turned away ln's beart, 1
Kings xi. 3. Neither, indeed, did this escape the philoso-
pher. Eth. vii. 10, Ὀυχ αμα <opertu-ccv καὶ ακρατη ενδεχεται εινα
τον aaron Wisdom amc z'ncontz‘nence in tlze same man are in-
compatz'ble. Gregory the Great, in Moral 33, says, that
blindness (ff tlte mind is tlte eldest daughter (gf luxury.

6. Because not only does it constitute the fornicator
himself guilty of eternal death, but those miserable beings
also with whom he sins. This greatly augments the ag-
gravation of this sin: for it is not so in other crimes. If a
man steals the goods of a woman, if he bears false testi-
mony against her, if, finally, he should kill her, he does
her an injury; but he does not involve her in damnable
guilt, because he does not make her a partaker of his sin:
but the fornicators defile them with their sins3 so that, al-
though they themselves repent, yet they are of necessity
tormented in mind, because as much as is in them they
have precipitated other souls into hell by the contagion of
their crime. Thus much as to the enormity of this sin.

Now let us hear, secondly, what is wont to be alleged
by those who deny that simple fornication (forI would use
their own words) is amortal sin: and also by those who,
when they have admitted that it is a mortal sin, yet con-
tend that brothels and prostitutes must be retained. The
former was not only an error of the heathen, but (if we be-
lieve Albertus*) of certain Christians: for he writes that
the Greeks openly defended this, and that it was refuted
