Ver· 8· EPISTLE To THE COLOSSlANs. 7¹

forts of evil speakers and detractors. Hence that prayer
of the Psalmist, cxx. 2, Deliver my soal, O Lom', from
lying lips, and from a decee‘tful tongue-

Thirdly‚ from the magnitude of the injury done to God
himself. For as God is praised in the saints when his
works which he effects in them are praised 3 so when the
saints are blasphemed and defamed by evil reports,>God
himselfis blasphemed z for as a consequence, this blasphe-
my redounds against God who is the author of holiness:
For the servants being wonnded an injur-y is (Zone to their
lord, Justinianus, Instit. imp. lib. 4. cap. 4, De injuriis.

Fourthly‚ from the punishment due to evil speakers and
detractors ς and that according to civil, ecclesiastical, and
divine laws. Justinian’s pandects have this passage, lib. 4,
cap. 4, De injuriis ; An i73jury is committed not only when (my
one shall have been struck with the fist ον α sticlc ; but likewise
when he shall even have been reproached. And the punish-
ment is awarded according to the quality of the reproach,
and also to the quality of the person affected by it. Gra-
tian, Caus. 2. quaest. l, has this passage, Is any] one qs the
clergy shall have ‹ffered reproach οι· contumely to his bz'shop,
let him be suspended. And Caus. 6, quaest. l, Let the ca-
szzm'ators and revilers ‹gf' their hrethren be held z'tffamous
(Cap. infames). As to the rule of Scripture3 in Levit. xix.
16, there exists a law of the same kind, Thou shall not go
up and dou-n as a tale-bearer among thy people. The punish-
ment is assigned, 1 Cor. vi. 9, lO, Neither thieves, nor co-
vetozcs, 7107' ‹lrzmlcm-cls, nor revz'lerS, nor extortioners‚ &c- shall
inherit the kingdom of God.

We will now deduce some Corollaries from these consi-
derations3 and first, such as respect the blasphemers them-
selves.

1. The passion and habit of evil speaking argues an
unregenerate man, and one still in a state of death and
condemnation: for it is reckoned among the principal
deeds of the olcl man.

2. Nothing is more unhappy than evil speakers and
slanderers: for as Nazianzen elegantly says, Itis the ex-
{reme of miser-y to place one's comfort not in one's own happi-
ness, bul in the evils (ff others.
