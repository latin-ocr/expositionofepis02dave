Cain, (Gen. iv· 9) therefore, never comes into his mind3
Am I my brother-'s keeper?

2. That haughtiness which is wont to bear any correc-
tion or brotherly admonition with an evil mind, is to be re-
jected 3 for it is the direct road to destruction, as solomon
forewarns, Prov. xxix. l.

3. These mutual admonitions are more grateful to the
godly and prudent, than flatteries are to fools : He that re-
