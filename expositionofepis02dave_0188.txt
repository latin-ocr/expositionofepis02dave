178 ΑΝ ΕΧΡοειτιοΝ or ετ. PAUL'S Chap. iii.

Therefore‚ in order to serve God, it is lawful and com·
mendable to renounce parents, and flee into a monastery.
I answer‚ The conclusion does not follow from these pre-
mises, unless when we cannot at the same time obey both.
But these words are spoken in a literal sense concerning the

daughter of Pharaoh, who could not at the same time re-
main in Egypt with her father, and obey her husband So-
lomon: they are understood in a mystical sense concerning
Christ and his sponse the Church‚ who cannot retain her
innate corruption and please Christ. But children are not
compelled by this kind of necessity to enter monasteries,
and desert their parents.—He brings certain other testimo-
nies of Scripture, but so foreign to the purpose, that I am
ashamed to be occupied in refuting such idle attempts:
Let us come then to the Fathers whom he quotes·

l. Ι unite them all under one testimony, that of Theo-
phylact‚ as the same answer may be accommodated to
them all. Thus, then, speaks Theophylactfi‘* on John xix.
It beliot-es them vot to obey parents opposing piet-y: and Gre-
gory, Hom. 37, on the. Evang.: Those adversaries whom we
meet in the way cf God, let us lsnow nothing of them, hy Izat-
iug and avoidiug them: and Augustine, Epist. 38, ad Lae-
tum, sayS, that he ought to be drawn from the perfect way,
neither by the command nor the entreaties of his mother.

'¹ The Theophylact here mentioned, and who flourished in the eleventh
Century, is to be distinguished from a writer and a Bishop of the Greek
Church, of the same name, who lived in the seventh Century. The Father
to whom reference is made as above, was Archbishop of Acris, in Bulgaria·
He was a native of Constantinuple, whose great reputation for Theological
attainments induced Maria, the empress of Michael Ducas, to urge him to
accept the See of Acris, in a province then nearly barbarous. He zealously
employed himself to diffuse Christianity in his province, and wrote several
works of such excellence as to rank him among the principal οἱ· the ecclesi-
astical writers of the period. He was living in 1071, but the exact time of
his death is unknown. His principal work is “ Commentaries upon the four
GospeIS‚ the Acts of the Apostles, and the Epistles of St. Paul.'' He also
wrote ί· Commentaries on the four minor Prophets.” Of these works seve,
ral editions have been published in Greek and Latin, and in Latin alone,
His ‘⁴ Epistles,'’ in number seventy-five‚ will be found in the Bibliotheca
Patrum. From the references here made to him and others, we have some
instructive specimens of the way in which the Roman Catholic advocates
corrupt or pervert the Fathers.
