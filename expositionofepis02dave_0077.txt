Ver. 8· EPISTLE TO THE eoLossxANs. 67

2. Because through anger, justice, the most illustrious
of all the virtues, is violated: for whilst an exasperated
mind sits in judgment, every thing which its fury may
suggest it thinks right. Hence James, i. 20, The wrath of
man worlskth not tlze righteotcsness of God. We have an ex—
ample in the sons of Jacob, who, when inflamed with an-
ger, perfidiously and cruelly slaughtered the Shechemites‚
Gen. xxxiv.; whence they merited that reproach of their
dying father, Cursed be their angerfor it was fleme, and their
wrathfor it was cruel, Gen. xlix. 7.

3. Because by anger the kindness of social life (which
is peculiar to man) is lost. Hence Solomon‚ Prov. xxii.
24, says, Malce nost-iendship with cm (mgr-y man ,· and with a
furious man thou shalt not go .· As if he had said, these are
entirely unfit for social life.

4. Because through anger the illumination of the Spirit
is shut out. For the God of peace dwelleth not iri a dis-
turbed and wrathsul heart, but in a mild and peaceful on'e.
Chrysostom, in Hom. 30, ad pop. Antioch.says; The Holy
spirit dwelleth not where ruge inhahits. Yea, he shews that
such men are more like those possessed with devils, than
men filled with the Holy spirit: for as demoniacs froth
and distort their countenances3 so angry men have their
minds foaming and distorted. See also Basil, De Ira.

5. Because through anger, which has an appetite for
revenge, the remission of our sins is hindered, and the
Divine wrath is provoked against us. Matt. xi. 26, If ηε
forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father which
is in heavenforgz've you your trespasses. Admirably speaks
Tei-tullian, De orat. How rash a thing is ic either lo pass a
day without prayer, or lo lose a prayer by continued anger?

6. Because by being ang-ry that which is the attribute
of God is usurped with sacrilegious audacity. Say not I
will recompence evil; but waitfor the Lord ancl he shall save
thee, Prov. xx. 22. Vengeance is mine, ancl I will repay,
Deut. xxxii. 35. But an angry man (as is commonly said)
makes himself fflejudge, and would have God to be the
‚executionem Yea, most commonly he would vindicate for
