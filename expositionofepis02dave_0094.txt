84 AN EXPosl'rloN or ετ. PAUL’s Chapstiiw

deeds of this old man are those sins afore-mentioned, and
others of the like kind extended to acts. He dissuades
from these in other wordS‚ but in the same sense,in Ephes.
iv. 22, T lzat με put off, concerning the former conversation, the
old man, which is corrupt according to the deceigful lusts.

He means that they have put off the old man sacramen-

one word: for if the old man (as Ι have before shewn) de-
signates the inherent corruption of our nature, with the
proueness and inclination of all our faculties to do evil;
then, by the law of contraries, tlze new man will designate
