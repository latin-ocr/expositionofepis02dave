Chap.i. oN ‘rim omem OF THE CONTROVERSY. 337

Christ, in such a manner as to exclude any one, before he
should exclude himself by his own unbelief. Let us hear
their own words. Philip Melancthon constautly admo-
nishes that we should not unseasonably mix the specula-
tion 0fi1Jredestination with the promises of the Gospel.
In his Common·places‚ On the promises of the Gospel,
page 195, he writes thus: As it is necessary to know that the
Gospel is a gratuitozcs promise, so it is necessary to know that
the (jospel is an universal promise, that is, that reconciliation
is offered and promised to all mankind. Itis necessary to hold
that this promise is universal, iu opposition to any danger-otis
imaginations on predestinatimz, lest we should reason that this
promise pertains to afew others aud to ourselves. But we de-
clare, that the promise (ff the Gospel is universal. And to this
are brought those universal eapressious, which are used coustantly
in the Scriptures‚ such as, Gon so Lovsst) THE νςῐοιῑω),Ι
ΤΗΑΤ ΗΕ GAVE His ONLY BEGo'rTEN SON,'1*}1AT WHO—
soEVER BELiEvETH ιΝ ΗιΜ SHOULD NoT Pelusii, BUT
HAVE EVERLAs‘rlNG LlFE. And the reason why all do not
obtain the promises of the Gospel, is because all do not believe
it. Calvin in many places gives his opinion in the same
manner. On the same w,01ds John 1ii. 16 (rod so loz-ed the

For this is the meaning of the word WORLD. For although
there is nothingfouucl in the world worlhy of the Divine fa-
tour, yet he shews himself to he propitians to the whole world,-
since he calls all without exception to believe in Christ. A
little afterwards : It appears that Christ is set before all, but
God opens the eyes of the elect alone to seelc him iufaz'th. And
on Rom. v. 18, He makes grace common to all, because it is
set before all, not because it is actually extended to all. For
although Christ sufferedfor the sius (ff the whole world, aud
through the goodness (ff God is offered to all iudiff'erently, yet
all do ποί apprehensi him. So likewise Bullingerj'ss on Rev.
