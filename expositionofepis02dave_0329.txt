question concerning the death of Christ, whether it was
to be extended to all mankind, or to be confined only to
⁴the elect. For the Fathers, when speaking of the death
of Christ, describe it to us as undertaken and endured for
the redemption of the human race3 and not a word (that
Iknovv of) occurs among them of the exclusion of any
persons by the decree of God3 they agree that it is ac-
tually beneficial to those only who believe, yet they every
where confess that Christ died in behalf of all mankind.
Thus Clemens Alexandrinus (Pedag. cap. ll) says, Thac

Christ freely brings and bestows salvation to tlze whole human
race. And of the same opinion is Origen‚ lib. 5, contra
Celsum, ,Iesus z's declared to have come into the worldfor tlze
sake (ff all wlco ever were sitmers, that tlzezs might leave tlzeir
sins, and give themselves up to Gorl. Withsswhoni agrees
primasius* on l Tim. ii. on the words leo gave lze'mscls ίι
ransomfor all: he says, For all men indeed, tlze broad of
Christ has been shecl, but it is bemy‘icial only to those tlzaj be-

adversaries were nevertheless accustomed to object to

³* Pmmsms, a Catholie Bishop of the ssth Century, a native of Africa,
who obtained the See of Adrumetum, also known by the name os Justi-
nianopolis, in the Province of Byzacene. About the year 550, 116 was one
of a deputation which was sent to Constantinople on the affairs of the Af-
rican Churches, and 116 was at that city in 553, when the fifth General
Council assembled there by order of the Emperor Justinian. He refused,
however, to take any share in the deliberations of that assembly, though
repeatedly invited ; and he subscribed to the Constitution which Pope Vi-
gilius issued in defence of the Three Chapters, i. e. the three pieces in the
writings of Theodorus of Mopsuestia, on the subject of the human and di-
vine natures in Christ. Priinasius was looked upon as a Commentator on
Scripture and a writer of some note in that age; and his Commentary upon
the Epistles of Paul, as also a book of his concerning Heresies, are yet ex-
tant ; but the former Mosheim regards as nothing more than a compilation
from the works of Augustine, Jerome‚ Anibi-ose, and others. Mosheim's
view of the writers of this period is worthy of the perusal of any 0116 who
desii-es to be informed in what sense the Church should be regarded as the
infalliblejudge of Scripture. He would also do well to peruse Bowei³s
Life of Pope Vigilius, and the account given under it of the occurrences
and men of this period, in order to judge of the claims of the Papal
Church to Apostolical Succession and Unity.
