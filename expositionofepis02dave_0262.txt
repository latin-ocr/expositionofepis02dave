by whose will they say they are governed ,9 Why have
they the Gospel, the Gospeh continually in their· mouth, when
their whole life varies from the precepts of the Gospel ? Thus
far Cyprian. Therefore let this primary business of wis-
dom be, so to walk, that our life may be an ornament, not
a disgrace to the Christian profession.

2. To beware that we do not so gratify the heathen and
ungodly, as to inflict a wound upon our consciences, by
communicating in any manner in theirsuperstitions. For
it is the character of an idle, and moreover of an impious
mind, to be led away from the Divine direction even in the
slightest degree in the business of Religion, and to pass
over to the adversaries' camp: neither is it the conscience
of the Christian only, sinning in this manner, which it
wounds, but it hardens the mind of the pagan also in his
superstition who witnesses it. Hence this communication
with idolaters is strictly prohibited in both Testaments.

And here it is worth while to consider the severity of the
antient Church towards those who incurred the least sus-
picion of committing idolatry, although they had done so
being compelled to it through danger of death. Diocle-
tian, Licinius, Julian, and other idolatrous emperors,
partly by fear, and partly by rewards, endeavoured to in-
duce Christians to offer incense to their idols 3 as may be
seen in Eusebius, Hist. eccl. lib. 8. cap. 3, and De vita
Constant. lib. l, cap. 473 and in Nazianzen, Orat. l. in
Julian. It might not seem perhaps of great moment to any
one, to throw a few grains of incense into the fire, at the
command of the emperor: but because this was done in
honour of the idols, severe decisions were passed against
