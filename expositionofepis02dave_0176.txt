intention either of contumely or injury. For if any one
who is angi-y with any brother, and breaks forth into bitter
words, shall be guilly of hell fire, Matt. v. 22, then how
much more he who does so against his wife? Therefore,
that all bitterness may be banished from the wedded state,
let that precept in Prov. v. 18, be kept in remembrance :
quoice witlz tlze wisi? ofthy ‘youth .· notstrz've, revile, threaten ;
but rejoice. .

3. Thirdly, Bitteruess, and that the most bitter, is
found in the actious3 namely, when the husband, plainly
unmindful what the conjugal relation is, shews himself a
tyrant, and treats his wife as his servant. The very insti-
tution of marriage repels this bitterness ι For God gave not
Eve to Adam as a servant or a slave, but for a companion
or help-meet. Thou art not α lord, but a lzuslntnd; thou lmst

1. When she is removed from all domestic rule, and is
degraded as it were to the rank osa maid, even perhaps
subjected to one of them. But the institution of marriage,
in which the wife is taken to the supreme administration of
the family under her husband, opposes this. Whence Xe-
nophon calls the wife the guardian osche domestic laws; and
Aristotle says, that she is to preside over the immoles. More-
over, the sacred Scriptures assign this to her, prov· xxxi.
273 Tit. ii. 5. Although, therefore, it ought to be plea-
sant to the wife to obey her husband ς yet it is bitteris he

compel her to be subject to his own servant, or if he do
not sufferher to preside. Abraham was unwilling to be

bitter in this respect against Sarah‚ and on that account
cast out the bondmaid from his house, who began to be
disobedieut and troublesome to her mistress ; as you may

gather from Gen. xvi.
2. Itis a branch also of this tyranny, when those things

which pertain either to her necessity or even to her dignity
are denied or taken away by the husband. For she, by
virtue of the matrimonial contract‚ ought to be a partner
