which are required in order infallibly to obtain eternal life.
And to this the reasoning of the Apostle has respect (Rom.
viii. 32) where he discourses of the privileges of those
who are predestinated, He that spared not leis ozon Son, buc
delivered lzz'm upfor us all, how slzall lze not with lzz‘m also
free& give us all things ,9 In which passage as he had before ·
intimated some special calling of the predestined, which
he named α calling according to purpose, so also he marks
some special oblation of Christ for these predestinated
persons, which may be called an oblation according to pur-
pose, that is, with a certain purpose of conferring effectual
grace on the elect, and infallibly leading them to life by
the merit of this death. Those who take away this dis-
tinction in the design of God, as to the death of Christ„
considered in relation to those who are elected and those
who are passed by, as Bannes truly says (in 1, quaest· 23,
art. 5, ρ, 296, 2970 Declare illac tlze merit of Christ is in no
degree more perfect as α cause of salvation to tlze predestinate
than to tlze reprobate. Because, as to the szgfficz'ency of lzz's
merit, it equally regards all men ; bac tlze dzff'erence is in tlzis,
that his merit is applied to some, but not to others. Therefhre
if the application as to the elect is not derivedsrom the merit
of Christ, his merit will Ιιαυε an equal regard to the predesti—
nate and tlze reprobate.

ARGUMENT 10. lf Christ did not offer himself to God
the Father with some peculiar and absolute will of re-
deeming and effectually saving the elect by the merit of
his death, then effectual grace and eternal life would not
be otherwise prepared for or given to any persons in Christ
than it was in Adam. For the possibility of having grace
and eternal life on a condition depending upon our free-
will, was granted to the human race through the first
Adam. If, therefore, Christ did not by his death merit
grace and life for any persons absolutely, but for all pro-
miscuously, on this uncertain condition, [f they should re-
ceive grace offered, aud believe in lzim, and persevere m saith,
and at the same time commite and leaves to the free-will of
each whether he is willing to believe and to persevere or
not, truly‚ as to the manner and uncertainty of obtaining
