cept by internally receiving, that is, by believing. These
things altogether and separately overturn the opinion of
those who say, either that all men promiscuously, or the
predestinated, as it were by a special privilege, are restor—
ed to a state of grace and actual reconciliation with God,
for this reason alone, that Christ suffered on the cross for
them.

Tbirdly, Theodoret, writing on those words of the Apos-
tle, Rom. iii. 25, leom God lzfatlz setfortb to be a propitia-
tz‘on tlzrouglzfaz'tlz in his blood, &Q says, lee Lord Christ is
the propitiation, and by lais blood procured our salvation, re-
quiring onlyfaitltfrom us. From which words we collect,
that Christ, with his death and all his mei-its, is so consti-
tuted the universal cause of our redemption, reconciliation, .
and salvation, that before the benefit of this redemption
and salvation procured by Christ is partaken of by any one,
it is necessary that this universal cause should be specially
applied to each individual. Now that this beneficial ap-
plication may be made, as Theodoret has well said, God
requiressaithfrom us. Therefore, while saith is absent, the
death of Christ, considered in itself‚ brings no one into a
state of actual reconciliation, of grace, and salvation.
Cyril is found to be of the same opinion, when (lib. 2,
cap. 74) explaining the words of our Saviour, John iii. 36,
He that believellz on tlze Son lzatlt everlasting life, and lze tlzat
believeth not the Son slzczll not see li e, he says thus, Christ
tlzerrffore qnz'clcens those wlzo believe in him, because as there
is α life according to natare, so lze dwells in all thefaitlzsul by
fitillz. Therefore, although Christ is life itself‚ yet he does
not quicken any but those who believe, which Cyril con-
firms by an excellent and forcible argument, namely, be-
cause he does not dwell in any but believers. Asis he
had said, The fountain of life does not actually quicken
any but those who are united to him, and none but believ-
ers are considered to be united to him. Those therefore
argue badly, who collect, whether from the death or from the
life of Christ, either that all, or any, are placed in a state of

life, grace, and salvation, before they are united to Christ
by the bond of saith.
