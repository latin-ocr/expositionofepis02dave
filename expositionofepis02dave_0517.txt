which words it appears, that the conversim] of the human
will to God does not depend on this condition, if it is
willing to obey of its own excitement3 but that the will
and the‘ power depend on the preparation of God, and the
gift of love. Again, Augustine says, (Epist. 107) How is
11 said, that all 111611 would receive grace, 1] 111036 10 10110111 11

shortly after, How are the ‘merits of the 1111111011 will weighed

111 a similar condition with those to whom ic 13 given, and yet

us hear the sentiments of others. Prosper sayS, leo dis-

all men of every condition and age; with him 1116 reason of
electiori 13 6011661116ιί ,· from that grace desert arises, bat 11 13 re-
ceived without merit. This testimony is to be observed, be-
cause although this author, whoever he was, contends that
the help is not totally taken away fron] any men, yet he
does not think that it is so offered to all, that the differ-
ence why one receives it and another does not, is referred
to this, that oue is willing to receive it, the other to resist
it3 but he refers the cause of the reception of grace to the
secret election of God, and consequently also the cause of
its not being received, as far as it is a mere denial‚ to the
secret non-election of God. But if it should be consider-
ed as a moral omission on the part of men who resist grace,
then it is to be referred to the corruption of mankind.
But to proceed. Fulgentius every where refutes this error
of the pelagiam, who think that saving grace is procured
for and offered to all men in Christ the Redeemer, as it
were on this condition, that some should have it, because
they were willing to receive it, others should be destitute
