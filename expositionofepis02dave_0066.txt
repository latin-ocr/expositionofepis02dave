never faiis, uniess the sinner repent, and forsake his wick-
edness.

2. If we now inquire, Why the wrath of God is poured
upon sinners, the reasons are at hand.

The first is derived from the Divine justice. For al·
though God is not pleased with the sins of nien, yet he is
pleased with his own righteousness, according to which,
punishment is due to sinners. Therefore, it is not evil in
God to punish the wicked, because it proceeds from the
love of righteousness3 but the evil is in man, to deserve
punishment3 because it proceeds from the love of wicked-
ness.

The second is derived from human advantage. For this
is the particular end of punishments‚ that they may effect
the amendment of sinners. Whatever tbe Divinity may
avenge before tbe last judgment, is not sor the destruction <ff
men, but is to be believed as intended for their recavet-y, Au-
gustine‚ contra epist. Man. cap. 1. Nor is it any objec-
tion to this argument that unbelievers are not so much ad-
nionished by these punishments to conversion, as blinded
to condemnatim, because this does not prevent them from
sowing the seeds of a good harvest among the godly3 for,
as Cyprian, De zelo, remarks, the punislaments of tlte im-
prudent coni-ey lzealth to the prudent.

The third is derived from the settled Providence of God :
For God is the author of order throughout the universe,
nor suffers any disorder to exist. But. yet sin by its very
nature is nothing else than mere disorder. As Aquinas has
truly observed, Quaest. disp. De pecc. orig. art. 8, Every
sin is restored to order by means of punishment, in that it re·
daces its inequality to a certain quality. And again, Quaest.
disp. De pecc. venial, art. 10, For it is just and determined
that be who wishes to seelc tlze pleasnre of sin against tlte Di-
vine will, shall be compellet] to experience tlte bitterness of
punishment against his own will. John Gerson has spoken
well concerning this matter, Part. 3, Whatever thing devi-
ates from one Divz'ne constitution is driven into another ; so that
which devinces from tlte constitution of mercis, rests in tlzat (ff
justice: where no less in cotfformity with tlzis constitution are
