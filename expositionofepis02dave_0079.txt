neighbour3 isit should tend to effect one's own revenge,
or the injury of one's neighbour3 if it should forestall the
judgment of reason, or be borne headlong with a loose
rein. For as Gregory in his Moral 5, cap. 33, well says,
The anger which impatience excites is oue thing ‚· the anger

3. When that which is the property of God is attributed
to the creature3 as if any one should say that the angels
created this world, or that they are omnipotent3 if any one
say that mere† men can remit the sins of other men, can
dispense with the penalties and punishments of the dead;
or that they can by infallible judgment prescribe articles
