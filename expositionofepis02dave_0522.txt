512 Α ῡῐεεΕητΑτιοΝ on THE DEATH or cunisr.

sal efficacy of the death of Christ beyond its proper li-
mits, That no law, no decree was established, in the ap-
pointment of the death of Christ, concerning the giving
of the means of supernatural grace, or concerning the
giving of saving or effectual grace itself to all men on the
condition, Ifthey make a good or not a bad use of the light
of nature3 or on the condition, If of their own will they
should not refuse it. Therefore, the death of Christ being
granted, God is bound by his faithfulness, according to
the covenant of the Gospel, to give remission of sins and
eternal life to every one that believes and repents3 but by
no covenant is he bound to give faith itself, love, or saving
grace to him that excels another in acting by the strength
of his free-will. Moreover, the gift or denial of effectual
and saving grace, the death of Christ being granted, re-
mains as free to God, as the gift of Christ himself was,
which is understood not to be due or given to any acts of
the human will. Therefore the obtaining or not obtaining
of effectual and saving grace, is to be referred in its first
origin, to the purpose of God in shewing mercy and pity,
or not sliewing it; and not to the free—will of man choos-
ing or not choosing. Hitherto we have disputed of the
death of Christ as far as its virtue and efficacy pertains to
all men. In what follows, we shall explain it as far as it is
limited to the elect children of God.
