earthquakes3 111 fine, their whole life is overwhelmed with
miserias and tears, as with inundations. It would be easy
to bring in more reasons3 but we shall be content with
these.

4, It now remains to shew, in the last place, the usual
liindrances to this subjecffion, and in the way of advice lay.
down, not all, but some of the principal of those things
which ought to be avoided. ,

1. Τ116 first is pride: which makes the wife think
highly of herself and all things belonging to her, as her
figure, her prudence, her family3 on the other hand, to
despise and disesteem her husband, as unworthy to com-
mand such a woman. To obviate this evil; l. Let her re·
member, that the dignity of her husband and her own in-

For she studies not to please her husband, whose greatest
displeasure is that she has got such a husband: on the
other hand, true love is a perpetual monitor, and the best
teacher of obedience. Retain Iove, says Augustine3f0r all
‹luties (Iepend upon it,· ὑπ] it you will possess what you leave
learnt, and what you have ζιοί learnt. If, therefore, love be
wanting, the wife neither knows how to please her husband,
nor cares about it. This evil will be avoided; 1. If pa-
