Chap. vii. As ιτ REGARDS THE PREDESTlNATED. 551

good pleasure ofGod, but rather from justice: because lt is
just that what Christ hath merited for these or those persons,
should be specially assigned to them. But this seems to
contradict the Apostle, who derives grace, and the infallible
salvation of the pledestinate, from the mere favour of
God,

REPLY, There is no opposition between these two
opinions, God justffies and saves Peter of pure grace, or of
his own mere good pleaszzre, and, Godjustffies and gaves Peter
in consideration of tlte merits ofClzrist being special& ordained
and acceptedfor the salvation of Peter. The reason of this
is plain, Because God, who, of his own mere good plea-
sure and pure mercy, determined to give saith and salva-
tion to Peter, determined at the same time not to give to ¹
him these things otherwise than through and on account of
the merits of Christ, destined for and given to Peter«in
some singular way, and that from the same good pleasure
and pure mercy. This good pleasure of God is opposed to
our merits, and is accomplished, not made void by the
merits of Christ being applied to us. From whence the
Apostle (Heb. xiii. 21) says, that God worlcs in us that
which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ.
Therefore‚ although it is of the mere good pleasure of
God, that he is willing to grant to Peter effectual grace
and salvation, yet this good pleasure is not accomplished
otherwise than through the merits of Christ. This, then,
is the sum of our reply3 Although every work of special
grace which is done in the elect is done on account of the
merits of Christ being specially applied to them, yet in
theirjustification and salvation is seen the true way of
mercy, and not of justice3 because Christ with his ments,
with this very mode of meriting and offering his merits,
some special regard being had to the elect, the whole of
this, Isay, derives its origin from the gratuitous good will
of God towards them.

OBJECTloN 2. If we admit that the elect obtain effec-
tual grace or saving saith because the death and merit of
Christ in suffering on the cross was applied to them by
some special intention, then we seem to admit that the
