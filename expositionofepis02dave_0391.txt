which predestination is united in an inseparable bond with
glorification, Whom lte did predestinate, them he also glori-
fied. Therefore, although we confess that the death of
Christ was in some way ordained by God for a common re-
medy of the human race, and would benefit all under this
Evangelical condition—if they should believe it, yet it
does not follow hence that all men individually are promis-
cuously elected 3 because God hath not determined to give
to all men individually that grace wherehy they may be-
lieve, and, by believing, may infallibly derive life from
this death of Christ. And it may further be added, that
although we should grant not only that Christ died for all
men, but also that on account of this death of Christ suf-
ficient grace was prepared and given by God to every indi-
vidual (which we do not hold), yet no one from these con·
cessions could rightly infer that all men are promiscuously ⁸
elected, or that there is no difference between the elect and
those who are passed by. The reason is evident3 Because
there is no sufficient ordination of means to procure the
salvation of man, were he predestinated, unless it should
be added, that there is an infallible order of special provi-
dence appointing and directing the ordained means to a
most certain attainment of the end, which nothing can
prevent. This may be illustrated by the example of angels
and men considered in a state of upright nature. All the
angels individually when formed were furnished with suffi-
cient grace, and thence sufficiently endowed to obtain
blessedness. But this does not prove either that there was
no election among the angels, or that they were all indis·
criminately elected. Thus Adam himself, at his creation,
and in him all his posterity‚ are understood to have been
supplied with sufficient grace and duly furnished to obtain
eternal life: but neither will it follow from thence that all
men were elected, or that there was no predestination.
For not every ordination to the obtaining of eternal life
either at once makes a man elected, or denies that he is not
elected, but only (as was before said) infaillible ordination.
That we may return therefore to our argument : From the
death of Christ, ordained to bc a propitiatory sacrifice for
