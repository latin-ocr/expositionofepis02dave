kind, or that by its benefit each and every man is received
into favour, and placed in such a state as, if he should
continue in it, he would possess eternal life : But that this
death of Christ is, according to the determination of the
Divine will, a remedy applicable for salvation to the whole
human race, or to every individual of the human race,
although in procuring and effecting its application, God in
an especial manner has compassion on some, and not on
others. You have heard this sentiment in some measure
confirmed by arguments. We will now vindicate it from
the objections which may be brought against it on the
other side.

OBJEc‘rxou l. First‚ therefore, it may be objected,
That at the time when Christ suffered death, many had
been adjudged to hell, and tormented there, but there is
no redemption from hell : How then can we contend that
the death of Christ was ever applicable in any way to these
condemned persons? Some, influenced by this argument,
have concluded that the innumerable multitude of the
wicked, who lived from the beginning of the world until
the coming of Christ, and who, on account of their im-
piety, were cast into hell, had no more right in the benefit
of redemption, before the sacrifice of Christ was offered
up on the cross, than the devils themselves. Thus the
Leyden Fathers speak in a writing which is extant in Vol.
9. Biblioth. Patrum, As the Lord Jesus Christ is by no means
said to have sztſj‘eredfor the wz'clced and condemned angels, so it
is not to be believed that he szgffered all things sor those impious
and condemned men.

Rnpms 1. But I answer, When we affirm the death of
Christ according to the ordination of God, and the nature
of the thing, to be a remedy applicable to every man, we
consider not merely the outward passion of Christ endured

ought to be acknowledged by every upright mind, that he was a sincere dis-
ciple and servant of the blessed Jesus.-In regard to the writings of Armi-
nius, it may suffice to cite the remark of an eminently useful and candid
Author. “ Some modern writers,” says he, ‘⁶ would be surprised to find
how Calvinistic Arminius is. He would certainly have been viewed by
them as a Calvinist.” Biclcerstetlz's Christian Siudent.
