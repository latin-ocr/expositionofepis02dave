their sins, assor as relotes to the work of reconciliation itself—
prepared and sufficientfor reconcilz'ng the whole human race.
But since reconciliation cannot talce place between the unwil-
ling, the Illinistry of reconciliation was appointed by God him-
self, by which all are called and invited heortz'ly to embroce
this grace. If the whole world would embroce z't, certainly
the whole world would be reconciled to God, all imputation of
sins being removed, and would be saved, nor would any morial
per-ish. Lastly, this also is added3 That the ministers <ff
this reconciliation should preach nothing else than the reconci-
tlatz'on made by God, aud so mode thot he ‘might reconcile the
world to himself through Christ, not imputing to them their
trespasses. To preaclz this grace faithfully, and lo call every
one to repentance cmdfaitlz in Christ, is to preach the word (ff
reconciliation. Thus far Musoulus. Those, therefore, who
altogether apply themselves and adhere to the secret of
predestination, so as at the same time to fritter away, and
evidently to subvert this reconciliation of the world, ,over-
turn also the ground of our preaching the Gospel, which
consists in this chiefly, that we assure every man, that
God is so reconciled to him by the death of Christ, that
if he believes in Christ, he will not impute to him his
trespasses‚ but will bestow upon him eternal life. This
work, confirmed on the part of God and Christ, is called
the¹ reconciliation and redemption of the world, although He
hath not willed that the unbelieving and impenitent should
be reconciled and redeemed. Thus Prosper speaks (ad
Capit. Gallor. object. 9.) The Redeemer of the world gave his
own blood for the world, and the world would not be redeemed.
Thus the Church of England speaks in the 3lst Article,
lee qffering (ff Christ once made is that perfect redemption,
propitiation, and satisfactionsor all the sins of the whole world,
both original and actual ; ancl there is 720 other satisfactionfor
sin, but that alone. Thus »also St. Paul speaks, when he
says, God was in Clzrz‘st reconcilz'ng the world to himself, that
is, God, by giving his Son to death, himself supplied for
his enemies an asylum of reconciliation, to which whoso-
ever flees for refuge, has God so appeased and reconciled
