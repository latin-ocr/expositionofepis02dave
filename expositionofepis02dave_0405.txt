wards some of those for whom Christ died than towards
others; as if they should determine to give to some not
only remissiori of sins and eternal life through the merit
of the death of Christ, provided they should believe in
this their Redeemer3 but also should choose some from
eternity unto life effectually to participate in Christ the
Redeemer, and should prepare for them and infallibly give
all those things which should effect this infallible partici-
pation and application. From these things it appears that
that inference is not tenable, Christ diedsor all; Therefore,
he loved all with the highest and with equal love; because,
this common benefit of his death being granted to all, yet
he may love some more intensely than others, and (160166,
prepare, and give to some more and greater benefits from
the merit of his death than to others. Which is evident-
in the elect themselves, for they all confess that Christ
suffered for all of thern, and yet no one would affirm that
Christ embraced with equal love every one (if Ι may so
speak) of the multitude of the elect, as he did the patri-
archs, apostles‚ or his own most blessed mother, or en-
riches every one with equal gifts of grace and glory re-
dounding from the merit of his death. But the other ar-
gument, in which it is intem-ed, Is Christ suffered deathfm·
all, he would shew greater love to the non-elect than to the elect,
because it argues greater love to endure dealhfbr any one to pro-
curefor him some little good than a great one, seems to me
little agreeable to right reason. If different kinds ofdeath
were to be suffered for different persons, this objection
might have some appearance of truth; but where one
death is endured for all, there it is evident that he is more
loved to whom he who dies intends more and greater bene-
fits from this one death. For if to love is to wish good
things to another, then to wish greater benefits is to love
more. But in this manner the love of the dying Christ
manifested itself towards the elect, and those who were
not elected3 for from one and the same death he willed that
more and greater benefits should arise to the former than
to the latter.
