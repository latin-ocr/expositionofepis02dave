mer Chapter. Now it consists of ,two parts: In the for-
mer he sets forth to masters their duty3 Masters‚ give unte
your servants tlzat which isjust and equal. In the latter he
adds a stimulus to perform the same, knowIng that με also
have a'Master in heaven.

Musteus] Having explained the duty of servants, he
would advise masters likewise of their duty: because no-
thing is more pernicious than a tyrannical master3 nothing
is more easy than to abuse command. Whence Plato says,
it is the best specimen of true justice, {f any one abstain
from wounding those whom he may easily injure. Ι subjoin
his very words, being· worthy of observation: Διάδηλος ὁ
<bum καὶ μη πλαστοῖς σέβων την δίκην, μισῶν δὲ ὅντως τοάδικον ἐν
τούτοις των ἀνθρωπων εν τῖις ἀυτῶ “ράδιον ἀδικεῖν. - De legib. 6.Ι

cordingly entered, and applying himself to study, he both made rapid
progress and became a good preacher. About the year 1518, he embraced
Lutheranism‚ which he supported with great zeal: this, as may be sup-
posed, created him a great many enemies. However, nothing dismayed‚
he made an open profession of his Religion z buthe was ere long compelled to
flee, and took refuge at Strasburg in 1527. Here he soon afterwards pub-
licly married; but having no provision whatever, he was obliged to send
his wiFe to service in a Clergyman's family, and bind himself apprentice to
a weaver, who shortly dismissed him on account of his religious principles.
In 1531 he removed to Augsburg, where, on the expulsion of all the priests
and monks in 1537, he was made minister of the church consecrated to the
Holy Virgin, which he held until 1548, when Charles V. having entered
the city, aud re-establishing popery, Musculus found it necessary to retire
ιο Switzerland, where, in 1549, he was invited by the Magistrates of Berne,
to the Professorship of Divinity. He died at Berne in 1563. Musculus
was a man of great learning and application, and considerable master of the
Greek and Hebrew languages. He translated the “ Comment of St Chry-
sostom upon St. Paul's Epistles ;” the second Volume of the “ VVorks of
St. Basil ;” the “ Scholia of the same Father upon the Psalms;'' the “ Ec-
clesiastical Histories of Eusebius, Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret, Evagrius,
and the History of Polybius.” He also published “ Comments upon some
parts of both the Old and New Testaments,” and was the author of some
original works both in Latin and German, particularly his “ Loci Com-
munes‚” or “ Common Places ;'' which, with other os his Tracts, were
published in England during the reign of Elisabeth, in conjuncti-on with
1116 writings oi* the principal foreign Rcibrmers.
