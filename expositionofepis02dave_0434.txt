that God predestinated all to be in Christ, so neither is
this to be understood, when it is affirmed that he was cru-
cified and died for all.

Lastly, Because the sacred Scriptures clearly extend the
death of Christ as a benefit applicable according to the
Divine ordination, to those who, through their unbelief,
do not apply it to themselves. They extend it, therefore,
beyond the number of the elect, of whom there is no one
to whom that ransom is not infallibly applied for salvation-
This is done in those passages of the Scriptures in which
the unbelieving are declared to be condemned, because they
believed not in the name of the only begotten Son <ff God, who
was sent into the world, that the world through him might be

necessarily required that it should be understood that he
died for them, with the absolute purpose of saving them.

From the Scriptores let us descend to the Fathers. It is
evident, that the proposition, Christ clz'edfor these men, had
not the same meaning with them as this, Christ will infalli-
bly save these men by his death. We shall content ourselves
with a very few testimonies, because the thing is well
known to those who are moderately versed in the writings
of the Fathers. Ambrose, on Psalm cxviii. affirms, that
Christ szfferedjbr all, and yet immediately subjoins, that
they who do not believe in Christ, cleprive themselves of this
general benefit. It did not then appear to Ambrose to be
