Ver. 25. EplsTLE To THE conossmns. 209

Vers. 25. But he that doeth wrong, shall receive sor the

wrong which he hath done ε and there is 720 respect <ff
persons.

In the foregoing verse the Apostle had encouraged ser-
vants to perform their duty properly, by proposing a re-
ward to them ; Now he stimulates them to the same duty
by threatening a punishment. But there are two parts of
this verse. The first contains a commination, or threaten-
ing of punishment to all who shall fail in their duty3 [ie
that doeth wrong, &Q The latter contains an anticipation
of an implied objection, which seems to lessen the certain-

ty of the punishment threatened ; And there ’ῖς no respect of
per-som.

He that doeth wrong, shall receive for the wrong which he
halh done] Some think this punishment threatened to
wicked masters for the comfort of servants τ 35 though the
Apostle had said, If your masters shall be unjust and
wicked, let not your minds be dejected, do not neglect to
perform for them whatever is in your power; but leave
your revenge to God, who will avenge whatever injuries
shall be done to you.

Imperious and impious masters are accustomed to wrong·
their servants in many ways. Sometimes they defraud
them of their clothing, food, or due wages3 Sometimes
they load and urge them by labours beyond their strength3
sometimes they affliot them with reproaches and unjust
stripes: almost all which things happened to the people of
God in the Egyptian servit'ude3 Exod. v. For wrongs of
this kind, let not servants rise against theirmasters through
impatience 01 anger, or leave the tasks imposed upon them
through idleness, says the Apostle. Whoever, in fine, he
shall be who does these wrongs to his servant, he shall re-
ceive from God himself for the wrong which he hath done:

that is, he shall feel vengeance and punishment corres-
