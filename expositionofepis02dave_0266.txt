of those times: but inasmuch as we do not now live among
them, we must use this wisdom towards heretics, towards
the profane, and atheists, who usurp indeed the name of
Cliristians, but nevertheless are altogether strangers to the
true and living Church of Christ. These persons, then,
are to be considered, either as they preside over or as they
are subject to true and orthodox Christians.

When they preside and govern, we shall walk wisely to-
wards them if we shall have performed those things which
were explained above by us.

When they are subject, and yet are frequently conver-

3. It behoves a pious and wise magistrate to employ

a double care towards all these strangers promiscuously:
First‚ to compel them by fines and punishments, at least

to attend the outward means of religion, namely, to be
present at prayers, and preaching, and the celebration of
the sacrament& Augustine frequently teaches this: ln
Epist. 48, he confesses that he was of a contrary opinion,
but afterwards found by experience, that the terror of the
laws and medicinal trouble are very necessary to the de-
