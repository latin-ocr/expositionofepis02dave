Ver. 1. EPlSTLE 'ro THE COLosslANs. 10

Hence we observe,

1. Itis the duty of Christians to imitate Christ, and to
do those things spiritually which Christ did corporeally.
For instance3 Christ died3 we ought in like manner to die
to sin: Christ rose again ; we ought also to rise to newness
of life: Christ ascended into heaven 3 it is our duty to soar
to heaven in mind. This is what the Apostle would have
us understand in Rom. vii. 5, where he requires that we,
being planted together, should coalesce together in confor-
mity as well to the death as to the resurrection of Christ.
The Apostle, says Chrysostom, would leave Cleristz'ans to be
partalcers with Clu-ist in all things.

2. It is not only our duty to rise with Christ3 but to
derive power from the resurrection of Christ for this spiri-

tual resurrection; for that virtue wherewith Christ raised Ι

himself, he communicates to all his people to raise up them
also. The argument, therefore, from the resurrection of
Christ is strong for our spiritual resurrection. Hence the
Apostle, having laid down the death and resurrection of
Christ, subjoins‘'0wroe και ὑμεῖς λογίζεσθε, διο. Likewise rect-on
[με also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive rento
God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Rom. vi. ll.

3. They are now inexcusable who still are absorbed in
earthly things and desires3 since they have a new nature
proportioned and inclined to the things which are above,
communicated to thern by the quickening power of the re-
surrection of Christ. Therefore, like as iron, which cannot
raise itself aloft by its nature, yet, by the operation of the
magnet acting upon it, is raised upward: so human minds,
by their own aptitude being set upon earthly things, by
virtue of the resurrection of Christ, can elevate themselves
to high and heavenly things. Thus much for the first in-
ducement. ⁴ ’

Where Christ sitteth, on thre right hand of God.] This is
that other inducement or spur to seek and affect lofty or
celestial things: Christ sitteth at the right hand of God3
therefore it behoves us to seek and to affect the things that
are above. First we shall explain the meaning of these
