Ver. lO. Eprsrmz To Tne conossmxs.

Vers. 10, 11.

Aristarchus my sellom-prisoner saluteth you, and Alarcus,
sister’s son to Barnabas, (lonching whom με received
commandments: if he come anto «zsozc, receive him.

And Jesus, which is called Jnsczfcs, who are ff the circumci-
sion. leese only are willfellow-worlcers mtto tlte king—
dom (ff God, which lzave been a comfort mtto me.

We come now to the last part of this Chapter, which
contains scarcely any thing else besides certain compli-·
mental salutations sent from different persons z In running
through which, because they are easy of explaliation,⁴we
shall be the more brief. For we ought not either to load
a plain text with too laboured a comment, or, as though
we held it not worthy of our consideration, wholly to pass
it by.

Three things, then, are here to be done by ns. 1. We
must speak concerning this duty of salutation generally.
2. We must explain so much concerning the persons send-
ing them as will tend to shew who they are. 3. Lastly, we
must speak of those eulogiums which Paul after his man·-
ner annexes in praise of every one.

Salutetlz ⁸yma] As to this first thing then3 this Greek
word Ασπάζεταιι signifies either to embrace, which friends are
accustomed to do when they return from a distance3 or to
salute, as we are used to do those whom we meet by word of
mouth, and absent friends by letters, as well in our own
name as that of other persons. Now this salutation is the
auspicious prayer of health and happiness from its author
God, out of a benevolent mind.

The forms of salutation are various3 but all agree in
this, that we salute him whom we wish alljoy and pros-
perity from God. Christ himself most commonly was ac-
customed to use this form, Peme be to you,- Luke xxiv.36,
