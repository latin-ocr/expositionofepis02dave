184 AN EXPOSlTloN OF ετ. PAUL's Chap. iii.

In the last place, Chrysostom is cited, who in the end of
lib. 3, against the censurers ofa Monastic life, thus speaks
to parents, Is yson shall oppose it. your children, 1“] they
should he eadhed with distinguished υἱνίιιε, although you should
be unwilling the-fas mci-is orrive at this monastic philosophy, they
will eigjozs eternalpleasures ; but yon will heap toyourselves in-
finite tor-ments. This testimony I have deferred to the last
place, because it appeared the most valid.

But I answer, It appears from that book of Chrysostom
that all things at that time were most corrupt both in city
and town, so that he says they deserved to have fire and
brimstone rained upon them no less than Sodom and Go-
morrha. Hence he takes the occasion of exhorting parents
to send their young children and as yet not corrupted by
the common contagion, into seclusion among the Monks‚
in whose schools there was somewhat of piety and the
Christian Religion: not that they should be perpetually
bound over and above the will of their parents, by I know
not what rules, as it is now done; but that, being well
grounded in piety and religion, they might reverence their
parents, and be to them both a comfort and greater help
through their whole life. These things being largely ex-
plained, at length he subjoins the words adduced by Bel-
larlnin3 Your children, 1] they should be endued with distin-
guished virtue, although you should be unwilling they should
arrz've at this monastic philosophy, &a He does not say,
should become monhs against your will, and whollyforsalce you ,-
but shall ort-ive at this monastic philosophy, that is, shall
learn Religion and Christian piety, which then flourished
particularly among the monks. This is the meaning of

“ in the Church, which we have learned from the Scripture and the Tradi-
“ tion of the Apostles.'’ Du Pin. Cent. lv. p. 268.

On the sense of this last sentence, and the proper acceptation of the term
Tradition‚ so grossly abused by the Modern Church of Rome, the Trans-
lator would take occasion to refer his Readers to an instructive and able pub-
lication of the Rev. James Phelan, entitled, The catholic Doctrine of Tra-
dition as opposed to that of the Church of Rome. Dublin, 18293 and no-
ticed in the Protestant Journal for August, 1831. The more learned Read-

er anal Controversialist will not omit to study Archbishop Laud’s Conference
with Fishcr the Jesun.
