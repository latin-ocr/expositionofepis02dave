sacrifice offered, but to the act and intention of the offer-
ing. 1 Tim. ii. 6, leo gave himself a ransomfor all. The
Apostle does not say, This ransom in itself‚ and in its own
intrinsic value, is sufficient for the redemption of all, but
in reality was given for a few, not for all; but, he gave
himselffor all. Therefore, the intention and aot of Christ
in giving himself includes all mankind, in like manner as
that of the Father in sending his Son; God so loved the
world, &c. (John iii. 16.) Therefore, the mere sufficiency
of the thing cannot so far avail, that Christ should be af-
firnied to have died sufficiently sor all, without an or-
dained sufficiency to all from the intention and act of his
offering.

ARGUMENT 3. Christ is acknowledged to have died
sufficiently for all men, in that sense in which it is denied ·
that he died for the fallen angels. This is plain, and ad-
mitted by all the orthodox, who often mention this differ-
ence between the evil angels and some bad men, at least
while they are living in this world. The words of Ambrose
on Ps. cxviii. refer to this, The earth is full Of tlte mercy (ff

for all. But if am) one cloes not believe in Christ, he deprz'ves
himself of that general benefit. A little afterwards, Perhaps
you will say, Why is ξι not said, that heaven is full of the
mercy of the Lord? Because there are spiritual wiclcednesses
in heavenly places, but the common benefit of Diviue pardon (md
the remissiori cf sins does not pet-lain to them. From which
things it appears, That Christ so suffered for the whole
human race, that all men have from thence a common
right of obtaining pardon through saith, which the demons
have not, because he did not in any way die for them.
One of our own countrymen‚ who contends strenuously
for limiting the death of Christ, yet willingly grants this,
(Ames, apud Grevinch. p. 55) lee szffciency of the death
does not rffer in elie same way to mankind as to devils. He
paid α sufficient ransom for all men, {f they would only em-
hrace it, but uotsor devils. This difference in the payment
