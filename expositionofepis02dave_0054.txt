44 AN EXPOSITION OF ετ. PAUL'S Chap.iii.

for him to deflour the daughter of another3 because this is
the wish of an evil and inordinate will.

Let us now come to the Papists‚ who concede that for-
nication is a mortal sin3 but maintain, ‚nevertheless‚ that
brothels and public harlots should be allowed in cities‚lest
the inclination of lustful men should transgress against
married females. In haman governments, says Aquinas, Q.
2. qu. 10. art. ll, they wlzo presidffijastly tolerate some evils,
lest they should incur worse: and he instances lewd women.
This was the very plea of the heathen3 for thus says Cato,
Yonng men ought to have recourse to har-lots, lest they should
approach tlze wives of others. But Augustine also is called
in to their aid, and that expression, Talae away harlotsfivm
human society, ond-reson will disturl) all things by lust, is cited
from his lib. 2. De ordin. cap. 4.

Ι answer,

1. The Papists favour fornication too clearly, when for
the sake of avoiding adultery, they tolerate fornication,
and to avoid fornication do not allow marriage. Ι speak
of the Clergy and Monks‚ to whom the extraordinary gift
of continence is not granted by God. For why do they
tolerate fornication among the laity‚ which they say is a
mortal sin, and not allow marriage among the clergy, which
the Holy spirit, Heb. xiii. 4, has pronounced to be honour-
able in all,· unless that (whatever they contend to the con-
trary‚) they do not cordially and sincerely determine it to
be a deadly sin? Hence that observation, Dist. 82, iu
Gloss : They declare tlzot no one is now to be rejectedfor sor-
m'cation, because our bodies ore morefroz'l tlmn they were for-
merly. And Caus. 2. qu. 7, in Gloss, No one is at tlzz's day
to be rejectedfor simpleform'calion. It is clear, therefore,
that the Papists are the manifest Patrons of fornication:

nor is it to be wondered at if they so willingly abst-ain from
wedlockfl‘
