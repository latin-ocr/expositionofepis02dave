design of application extended to all men individually ac-
cording to the infallible order of predestination 3 but there
is in God a certain obligation to remission‚ and a will of
remitting sins and confer-ring life extended to all men indi-
vidually, according to the tenor of the promise of the
Gospel. But Isay no more on this subject at present,
because when we come to our next proposition, we shall
designedly discourse of this same point more copiously.

OBJECTION 7. The will of the Father‚ the oblation of
the Son, the saving operation of the Holy Spirit, equally
extend to and respect the same persons: But it is the will
of the Father to save the elect alone: and the spirit, by
giving faith and perseverance, actually saves the elect
alone z Therefore the death or oblation of Christ is not to

ought not to be considered as a remedy from the ordina-
tion of God applicable to each and every man.

REPLY 7. If the major proposition is understood con-

regards in some way certain persons whom predestination
does not embrace. PredestinatiOn is the secret decree of
God by which he determined with himself from eternity to
whom he would infallibly give efficacious grace and eternal
life through the infinite merit of the death of Christ: But
the oblation of Christ on the cross is a common benefit
granted to the human race, by virtue of which any one
who only embraces it with a true saith, may claim for him-
self eternal life according to the will of God revealed in
the Gospel. So Christ himself speaks, John iii. 14, 15, As
Moses lifted up the serpent in ‘the wilderness, even so must the
Son of man be lffted up, tlzat wlzosoever believetlz in him should
not pet-ish, but have eternal lg'fe. Although, therefore, the
predestination of God, and effectual vocation, which de-
pends upon it, embraces no one not elected, yet, as the
offcring os Christ in the Gospel, so also the oblation of
