Ver. 24. EPISTLE To Tne conossmns. 205

mise of a reward, in the former verse3 from the threat of a
punishment, in the latter verse.

As to the former verse, we have in it, 1. The promise of
the reward itself3 Knowz'ng tlzat of tlte Lord ye shall receive
tlte reward qf' the ittlzeritmzce. 2. The confirmation of the
reward promised 3 fbr με serve the Lord Christ.

In this promise we may observe‚ first, the Author or Be-
stower of the reward promised, namely, Christ3 Knowz'ng
that (gf the Lorcl με shall receive.

The Apostle rightly and prudently would have those
servants to expect a reward from Christ. For earthly mas-
ters give food and clothing to their slaves, whether bought
or taken in war: they thought not any other reward to be
due to them more thau to their beasts. Food is the slave's
mages, says Aristotle, Oecon. i. 5. The ApOssse, therefore,
consoles these servantsf‘ss that although they are neglected
by their earthly masters, yet they have a heavenly master
a munificent rewarder, who will not suffer them to be des-
titute of a reward, if from the heart they obey their mas-
ters, and as it becomes pious men and Christians. There-
fore he joins that word ειδοτες, lcnowffg, or taking z'tfor cer-
tain: because it is wicked even to doubt concerning the
reward which Christ himself lias undertaken to bestow:
for however men are accustomed to withhold and deny the
reward engaged for, yet Christ neither ever will do so, nor
can he. Thus much of the Author or Promiser of the re-
ward.

Secondly‚ let us observe the quality of the reward sig-
nified by this addition, ἀνταπόδοσιν τῆ ς κληρονομιας, Ille reward
(ff tlte inherz'tance. These things seem to be incongruous:
for α reward is paid to labourers3 αη iuheritanoe is given to
children. But the Apostle would indicate, that he is not
speaking of any temporal reward, which should corres-
pond in equal value to their work; but of that eternal re-
ward of blessedness‚ which surpasses far and wide all the
worth of human works or duties.

³ The reader will bear in mind, that the word servants is used here for
slaves, δουλοι, in conformity with the authorised version of the Bible.
