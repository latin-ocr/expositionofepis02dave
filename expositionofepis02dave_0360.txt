into his favour.

5. The fifth testimony is derived from the epistle to the
Hebrews (chap. ii. 3, and iv. l, 2, διε.) How slzall we es-
cape, ff we neglect so great salvation? which at thefirsc began
to be spoken by tlte Lord, and was corfirmed unto us by them
that heard kim, διο. Let us therefore sear, lest a promise being
left us (ff enter-ing into lzz’s rest, any ofyou should seem to come
short of it. For unlo us was tlte Gospel preaclced as well as
unto them, but tlze word preached did not profit them, not being
‘mixed wiehfaitlz in them tlzctt heard it. Let us lahour there-
fore to enter into tlzat rest, lest any man sall after the same
example of unbelief. From the whole of this discourse of
the Apostle, it appears, in the first place, that in the Gos-
pel, salvation is offered promiscuously to all those to whom
it is preached3 sor on this very account it is called salva-
tion, Then it appears, that this salvation which is laid up
in Christ, and offered to men in the Gospel, is neglected
and repelled by many, namely, by all unbelievers who have
not saith in the promises of the Gospel. Lastly, it also
appears, that this neglect and unbelief is the true cause
which prevents the ungodly from obtaining the rest of the
Lord, that is, which deprives them of eternal life offered
to them in Christ. But none of these things can be said
truly and seriously unless it is presupposed that salvation
through the death of Christ is applicable to all men, ac-
cording to the appointment of God. For who can pro-
perly be said to have neglected salvation, that is, the cause
of salvation appointed and prepared by God, which never
was prepared or appointed for him, or applicable to him?
Or how does this neglect and unbelief exclude them from
a participation in the salvation offered through Christ, who
were entirely excluded from it· on account of a defect of
the appointment of God? We must therefore admit that
there must necessarily be some appointment of God, ac-
cording to which, Christ, as a cause of salvation, was
applicable to them who fell from salvatiou by their own
fault.
