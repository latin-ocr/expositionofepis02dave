as guilty in the room of those traitors‚ and should suffer
the punishment due to them all, this condition being at the
same time promulgated both by the King and his Son,
That none should be absolved or liberated except those
only who should acknowledge the King’s Son for their
Lord and serve him: These things being so determined, I
enquire, if those who persist in disobedience and rebellion
against the King’s Son should not be delivered, would any
charge of injustice be incuroed, because after this ransom
had been paid, their own debts should be exacted from

all, or any intention of its application. It remains, there-
fore, that we assert, that beyond the sufficiency of the
price, nothing redounds to the death of Christ which has
regard to all rnen.

REPLY 6. To meet this objection, we should observe,
in the first place, what kind of sufficiency they mean who
