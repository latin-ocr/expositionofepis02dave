382 Α nlsSERTATloN oN THE DEATH OF CHRIST.

all men individualiy, and applicable through faith for the
obtaining of remission and salvation, it does not follow
that election and preterition is taken away 3 because this
common ordination which is revealed in the Gospel being
granted, there is also a certain secret ordination, according
to which the aforesaid death of Christ is decreed to be infal-
libly applied to some personS‚ to whom God will manifest
his special compassion3 it is not decreed to be so applied
to others, upon whom God will not have compassion in the
same manner. And this is abundantly'sufficient to defend
the doctrine of predestination and reprobation, although
we extend the death of Christ to all men in the aforesaid
sense.

OBJECTION 9. Some dispute, by means of an argu-
ment deduced, as they think, from similar circumstances,
in this manner ; It is as foreign from truth that Christ died
according to the ordination of God, for some who are not
saved, as that some are saved for whom, according to the
ordination of God, he did not die: But this it would be
absurd to assert: so likewise the former.

REPLY 9. Ι deny that the reasoning is similar on both
sides. For (as it is a received maxim in Divinity) Good
orises only from. pure sources, evil from any kind os deffect :
The salvation of mankind therefore, which is the greatest
good, is not produced without a full concurrence of all
causes3 but the loss of salvation, which is an evil, may
happen from the defect of any one cause ordained for the
salvation of mankind. Although it is impossible that any
persons can be saved for whom Christ did not die, because
the death of Christ is one of those ordained causes which
operate to the salvation of mankind3 yet it is not impos-
sible to cut off some from salvation for whom he did die,
because it was not appointed by God that the death of
Christ alone, by the act of his oblation, should render
God propitious to all, and should save all, but that it
should be α propitiation, through saith in his blood, to declare
liis righteousness jor tlze remissiore of sins that are past,
(Romans iii. 25), and it is unco all ond upon all tlzem tlzac be-
liene,- [ον tltere is uo difference, as it is said in the 22d verse.
