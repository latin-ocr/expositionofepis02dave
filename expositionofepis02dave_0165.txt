Ver. 18. nersrLE ‘ro Tan conossmNs. 155

3. We must now come, in the third place, to those rea-
sons which ought to excite and impel all good and pious
matrons to perform these duties of subjection.

1. The first is derived from the Divine appointment;
which it is wicked for a pious mind to resist: for religious
obedienoe does not discuss the commands of God, but
performs them. But God most clearly has sanctioned this
female subjection, Gen. iii. 16, Thy desire shall be to thy
husband, sub viri potestate eris, in the Vulgate; and he shall
ναῖε over thee.

2. The second is derived from the natural imperfectiori
of the woman: For by nature she is more infirm than the
man, and more unsuited for her own government and pro-
tection. This both the sacred Scriptures and· philosophy ι
testify. Women are said to be tlze wealcer vessels, 1 Pet. iii.
7. And Aristotle affirms, that they have indeed the power to
determine, but without authority ; and that it is the leading
quality of the woman to subserve‚ not to direct. Polit. lib. i.
cap. 8.

3. The third is derived from the order of creation. For
the woman was created after the man, out of the man, and
for the man. But the end for which any thing exists‚ is
better and more noble than the thing itself. This is urged
by the Apostle, 1 Cor. xi. 8, 9.

4. The fourth is derived from the transgression of the
woman. For she being seduced, violated the Divine com-
mand, and allured her husband into a participation of her
transgression: Now it is just, that from thenceforward the
wife should hearken to her husband, because the husband
was ruined by hearkening to the wife. The Apostle makes
use of this argument, l Tim. ii. 14.

5. The fifth is derived from the disadvantage of refus-
ing this subjection, and dist'urbing the Divine ordination.
For as in physical things, the disturbanoe of natural order
yields many and great disadvantages, storms, floods‚ and
earthquakes3 so by the order of the due subjection of the
wife towards her husband being disturbed, brawlings and
clamours are heard in the house, like thunder3 their bo-
soms are shaken by fear and mutual suspicions, as bv
