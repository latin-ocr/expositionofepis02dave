covenant Rupert observes, (in 4, Gen. cap. 34) We say
that that coveuant, by which alone the enmitz'es were removed
which had subsistent between God aud men, was many times
indeed piwmz'sed, but once execnted, namely, by the passion of
Christ the Son of God. For in this, without any contradic·
tion, is α certain foundation ofpeace, while God, accepting
thefaith of men, gives to them Christ his Son, that they may
he saved ὂψ him. Therefore no doubt is to be entertained of
this appointment of God, founded on the death and me-
rits of Christ, and having respect to all men individually.
But it is still questionable, whether, granting this univer-
sal covenant of giving eternal life to all men, if they
should believe, God exercises his liberty, andexhibits his
special mercy, in giving to the elect that saving faith by ’
which they may believe, and that through Christ, and on
account of his merits, applied to them by some peculiar
privilege. The thing speaks for itself. For we see that
the elect, and the elect alone, eventually obtain from God
persevering and saving faith. But suppose that so great
a gift were specially given to them in any other way or
respect, than on account of the merits of Christ, ordained
and applied to them by some special intention of God; it
is altogether unlawful to suppose it. For as Ambrose ex-
cellently says on Eph. i. 2, (He hath blessect us with att
spiritual blessings ἱη Christ), Εἶπεν-3] gg's't (ff grace is through
Christ. These things being settled, although (as I said)
it is useless to dispute of the congruity of Divine actions
where there is evidence of the facts themselves, yet, that
no scruple may be left, we say, first, That this special in-
tention of God, according to which he determined with
himself, on account of the merits of Christ, to give to the
elect the special benefits of e-ffectual grace and salvation,
does not clash with that conditional compact, leosoecer
belieceth shall be saved, but is rather a kind of special de-
sign subordinate to the infallible fulfilment of this univer-
sal compact. For those who trust to their own free-will,
with some little helps of grace, repel or oppose saith.
Lest, therefore, this universal compact should not bring
the effect of salvatiou to any one, God, by a special and
