fered for them alone. And therefore this oblation or death
of Christ is not a remedy or ransom applicable‚ according
to the ordination of God, to each and every man.

REPLY 10. We may consider the giving or oblation of
Christ in a twofold point of view. The first is that in
which he is understood to have been given or offered to
God the Father on the altar of the cross, to take away the
sins of the world: of which the Apostle sayS‚ l Timothy
ii. 5, 6, T here is one God and one Ilffediator between God and
men, theman Christ Jews: wlzo gave himself a ransom sor
all, namely, to God the Father, as it is more clearly ex-
pressed Ephes. v. 2, Clzrz'st bath loved us, and hatlz given
lzimsefffor us an offering and α sacrifice to God for α sweet
smelling sat-our. This oblation is the foundation of every
future offering, by which he is offered to men in the Gos-
pel, that, being apprehended by faith, he may bestow upon
them eternal life through the merit of this sacrifice. Of
this oblation the same Apostle speaks, Romans iii. 24, 25,
We are justffied freelzs by his grace, tlzrouglz the redemption
that is in Christ Jews, whom God lmtlz set jbrtlz to be a pro-
pitiation, tlcroztglzfaitlz in his blood, &Q [f we regard the
former oblation, Ι deny that Christ offered himself a sacri-
fiee, or gave himself a ransom to God the Father to ex-
piate the sins of the world, under the condition of human
faith, as it were in this form, Ι ‹ffir myself to Thee as α ,ςα-
crfficesor tlte sins of the human race, provided they believe in
me. For he offered himself simply, not conditionally, to
God the Father3 which is proved from hence, that the
Father, according to whose will the Son offered himself a
sacrifice, did not determine with himself to give a Re-
deemer to the world under this liypothesiS‚ If the world
should believe; but God gave his Son to the world, and
the Son gave himself to the Father a ransom to take away
the sins of the world, gratuitously and absolutely. A
condition indeed is annexed in the preaching of the Gos-
pel, not to the giving, but to the eternal life which is to
follow from the beneficia] application of the. thing given.
Therefore‚ as to what regards the latter oblation‚ by which
