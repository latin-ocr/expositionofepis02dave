in the house of this distinguished man, for exercising sa-
cred duties, that is, for prayer, for preaching the word,
and the celebration of the sacrament; or they denote his
private family, which for its religious sanctity merited this
illustrious name of Church, Rom. xvi. 5. So Theodoret
thinks, who thus writes on this passage, He made his pri-
