to men and be accepted in their name? Truly, if any one
should endeavour to do this, he would do it in vain. For
the merit of Christ is a benefit to us only usfar as it was αε-
cepted by God, as Scotus hath taught, not disagreeing with
this our opinion (lib. 3, Dist. 19, Qu. vinc. p. 74.) But it
was not accepted by God, that he should procure actual
remission of sins and reconciliation for any mortal man
before repentanee, saith, and ingrafting into Christ. There-
fore, he does not actually justify or reconcile to God any
but those who repent and believe. But that it was not so
accepted that he should reconcile any one before saith,
appears from an argument derived from the Scriptures ne-
gatively in this manner: No word occurs in the holy Scrip-
tures from which it can be collected that merely by the ,
virtue and efficacy of the death of Christ all men are pro-
miscuously restored to a state of grace, or that any man,
whether elect or non-elect, before repentance and saith,
obtains, by virtue of the blood of Christ shed on the
cross, remission of sins, or actual reconciliation with
God. Therefore it is rash to assert it. Neither is there
any reason why a man should reject an argument of this
kind derived from the authority of the Scriptures nega-
tively. For although in lesser matters, which do not re-
late to the chief cause of our salvation, the reasoning
would be weak—leis is not laid down in the. Scriptures, there-
fore z‘t isfalse or unluwflcl; yet, in things necessary to be
done or known in order to salvation, such as the manner
of obtaining remission of sins and reconciliation with God,
it justly follows, This is not taught in the ScriptureS, there-
J'ore ic· is not to be believed by us. Since, therefore, the Scrip-
tures no where teach that remission of sins or actual re-
conciliation were procured by the death of Christ for any
individual before he repents and believes in Christ, it is
not to be admitted under the pretext of amplifying the
dignity of the death of Christ, or for any other reason.
Now, having established this by a weight of argumentS‚
we will also produce the sentiments of the Fathers, yet
very few of them. Ambrose, on faith, (ad Gratian. lib. 4,
cap. l) says, Is thou (lost not believe, he descended not sor thee,
