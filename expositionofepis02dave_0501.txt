right use of them. Since, therefore, all these things are
far from the truth, it remains that we should say that God,
notwithstanding the merit of the death of Christ, may and
cloes giye or deny the grace of applying this merit to indi-
viduals, according to the good pleasure aud freedom of liis
own will, and not according to the merits or various opera-
tions of the wills of mankind.

ARGUMENT 5. Our opinion is confirmed by the useful
ends which it serves to illustrate, and which are altogether
abrogated by the contrary opinion. For example, lf God,
the death of Christ being admitted, be assumed neverthe-
less to distribute the grace by which it may be applied, or

the death of Christ, to give remission of sins to those who
believe, and to give glory to those who are regenerate and
ingrafted into Christ, yet he hath not willed that he should
be obliged to give the Gospel to such and such nations or
individuals, or to give faith and efficacious grace in conse-

in the state of corrupt nature, without Christ. They,
therefore, go to diminish the Divine liberty which God
hath reservet] to himself, who teach that grace is commu-
nicated or denied to men according to their good or bad
use of nature; which is the same as if they should say,
That grace is prevented by nature.

Secondly, According to our opinion, that which the
Scriptures urge so much, becomes conspicuous, viz. the
