534 A nissERTA'rmN oN THE DEA'rH OF CHRJST,

But what we can do through Christ, we receive the power
of doing on account of the merit of Christ, which is not
given to any man without the antecedent and special in-
tention of Christ, who died and merited it. Therefore,
whoever has obtained this most excellent benefit, that he
should have the merit of Christ applied to himself effec-
tually, ought to confess, that he has received the power os
applying it more than others, from the special kindness of
God and Christ, who intended, destined, and applied this
his own merit especially to that person. Thus the event
of the beneficia] application of it in the predestinated, de-
monstrates that there was in Christ, who offered himself,
and in God, who accepted this sacrifice, a special and ef-
fectual intention of its application to the predestinated.
And this is that singular privilege of the elect in the death
of Christ which we have endeavoured to establish by our
proposition.

ARGUMENT 9. If it is asserted, that the death of
Christ, according to the appointrnent of God and the in-
tention of Christ, has not merited the effectual application
and infallible attainment of salvation which flows from it
to those who are predesffinated, it will iniproperly follow,
that the merit of the Mediator, according to the will and
intention of the Father who accepted it, and of the Son
who exhibited it, did not more regard those who are elected
than those who are passed by, but pertains equally to
both. The consequence is plain, because it is evident,
That according to the will of God, the meritos Christ in
dying extends itself to all men ou this condition, If they
should apply it to themselves by saith. Therefore, unless
Christ had intended by his death to merit for the elect, in
addition, that the beneficial application should be made to
them by faith being given to them, no special privilege
would be given to them in the merit of Christ. For the
death of Christ, according to the appointment of God,
merited this for Judas, that on the condition of saith he
might attain to eternal life3 but it obtained in addition for
Peter, that on account of the merit of Christ he should
receive persevering saith and all other spiritual benefits
