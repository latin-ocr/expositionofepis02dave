Ver. 20. EPlSTLE To Tur-2 COLOSfflANs. 179

Ι answer: All these are distorted by the very bad saith
of Bellarmin3 who, if he had looked into his authors, >
could not but perceive that they never even dreamt about
entering monasteries against the will of parents. Ι ap-
prove that saying of Theophylact‚ namely, That parents
opposed to piety are not to be obeyed‚· but, however, they
must be obeyed by children when they exact the duties of
piety3 and this is what we maintain. The words of Gre-
gory have respect to that saying of the Saviour, Luke xiv,
26, If any man come to me and hate not his father and his
mother, he cannot be my disciple. Therefore, they relate
equally to all Christians, not to monks alone. But Gre-
gory in that place best interprets himself, who immediately
adds these words to those which are adduced by Bellar-
min: Quasi per odium diligitur, qui carnaliter sapiens dum.
prava nobis ingerit, mm auditur. Gregory, therefore, means
no more, than that parents, when they act wickedly towards
their children, are not to be heard: which no one in “his
senses would deny. As to Augustine, He does not say
that Laetus could enter a monastery against the will of his
parents, whilst under their guardianship: nay, he no where
indeed ever asserts in that epistle that he was a monk3
but he shews that he was a preacher of the Gospel, and
ought not to be led away by earthly cares from the office
he had undertaken. The duty, says Augustine, qs preach-
ing the Gospel hurries thee along ; the relescz'al trumpet impels
the soldier of Christ to the battle, whilst his mother heeps him
back.- then a little aster3 Thy Mother the Clam-ch, is the mo-
ther of thy mother: she requires thyjust ancl dne assistance,
&c- Therefore what Augustine urges is true, That a prea-
cher of the Gospel ought not to he recalled from the office
he has undertaken, not even by the intreaties of his mo-
ther: what Bellarmin infers, that a boy may not be prohi-
bited from entering a monastery, not even by the command
and authority of his parents, is false.

Two testimonies are cited from Jerome3 one from his
first Epistle to Heliodorus, in these words, Althongh <z
