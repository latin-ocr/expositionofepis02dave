of chastising a wife by stripes is supported by no law
either Divine or human.

Finally add, That is not to be done which cannot be
done without sin, and what always derives its origin from
this sin of bitterness. For a'lthough parents often chastise
their children from love3 yet both the experience and con-
science of every one will testify‚ that no one proceeds to
beat his wife except from anger, bitterness, or hatred3 all
which are unlawful things, and diametrically opposite to
the matrimonial state. Therefore, let all bitterness be done
away.

So far we have spoken of the duty of wife and husband.
In the next place the duty of children and parents fol-
lows; among which the second domestic relation is
placed.

Vers. 20.

Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well-
pleasing nmo the Lord.

We have said that the second domestic relation subsists
between parents and children: therefore the Apostle en-
deavours now to imbue these with wholesome instructions
in this place. And as he began in that relation ordained
to be prior, from the duty of the wives; so now he begins
from that of children (as I conceive) for the same reasons,
or at least not much unlike. The Apossse, then, follows
this order3 both because children oftener fail in the duty
of obedience, than parents in that of love; as because this
duty of obedience rightly discharged, cannot but draw
parents to the discharge of their duty. But let us corne to
the words.

We have in them a precept3 Children, οἰκῇ] your pa-
rents, &c. and the reason of the precept 3 jbr this is accept-
able to tlte Lord.
