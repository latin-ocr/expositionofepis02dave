550 Α DiSSERTATloN oN THE DEATH OF CHRIST,

quisicz'on (ff these sheep. 1 ask, what this is which Vorstius
concedes to us, when he grants, that not all, bnt some, were
redeemed by the death of Christ in α special way and peculim·

and salvation not so much to the good pleasure and special
mercy of God, as to some kind of justice, For if it
should be inquired, why Peter rather than Judas received
effectual grace and salvation from the merit of the death of
Christ? it will be answered, according to our opinion,
Because Christ, by his special intention, and by the appli-
cation of his merits, merited that for Peter which he did
