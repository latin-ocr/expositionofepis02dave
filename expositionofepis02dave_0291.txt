his captivity or bonds, but by way ofhonour calls himself
and this Aristarchus also fellow-prisoners.

2. That they are to be accounted‚ both by thejudg-
ment of God himself, and of the Church, companions of
the same sufferings with prisoners and martyrs, who are
wont to aid them and bear the burden and heat out of cha-
rity: for in this respect this Aristarchus is deemed the
fellow-prisouer of Paul. This much of Aristarchus.

And Marcus] Called also John, in Acts xii. 12. He had a
pious and religious Mother‚ Mary of Jerusalem: in whose
house the Apostles and other Christians were accustomed
to meet for prayer, preaching, and other spiritual exer-
cises3 as may be gathered from the same place. Mark
was esteemed the most celebrated as well for many other
things, as especially for being the writer of a Gospel, which'
he had learnt from Peter, as Eusebius writes, lib. 2. Hist.

Hence also he deservedly obtained an illustrious name in
the Church of God, because he moreover helped the apos-

that the churches through all Egypt were founded chiefly
by his labour. Dorotheus iu his Synopsis relates‚ that he
was first Bishop of Alexandria, and was there honoured
with the crown of martyrdom under Trajan. Jerome also,
in his Catalogue of Ecclesiastical writers, states that he
was buried in the same city.

When, or by whom he was converted to the Christian

very probable that he was converted by Peter. The fol-
lowing considerations make this credible: l. Because Peter
was wont to frequent the house of his mother for the sake
of prayer and preaching‚ as was before shewn from Acts
xii. Therefore it is very likely that he was enlighteued
by him. 2. Because the antieuts, viz. Irenaeus and Euse-
bius, relate, that he derived the Gospel history from Peter.
Hence Irenaeus calls him tlte disciple osPeter. 3. Because
Jerome, in Isa. lxv. broadly affirms, that Paul converted

This Peter himself also seems to have indicated clearly
