their multitude. For instance3 It is a proof of greater
virtue and excellence to restore sight to one blind man
than to put out the eyes of a thousand men3 to heal one
maimed and diseased man, than to mutilate or poison a
thousand whole and healthy men3 in a word, to recal one
man to life, than to put a thousand to death. For a like
reason, the power of Christ by his death is greater and
more efficacious in the salvation of only one man, than
that of Adam in destroying by his sin the whole human
race. To the minor proposition it may also be answered‚
That the act of the sin of Adam does not bind any man
under the penalty of death, or render him obnoxious to
the wrath of God, unless from hence, that he was propa-
gated from sinful Adam by natural generation. And in
the same manner evidently the act of the death of Christ
does not deliver any man from a state of death or from
Divine wrath, any further than he is derived from Christ
by a supernatural regeneration. Therefore the condition
is equal on both sides, if ajust comparison be made. All
who are naturally descended from Adam have lost the grace
of God and eternal life. All who are supernaturally rege-
nerated by Christ recover the grace of God and eternal
life. No man is subjected to death or Divine wrath by the
fault of the sin of Adam, unless he has derived a natural
origin from him. No man is delivered from death or Di-
vine wrath through the merit of the death of Christ, unless
he has derived from him a heavenly birth. This is wisely
and learnedly explained by Aquinas (Contra Gentil. lib. 4,
cap. 55,) where he has these words, The effect of the sin (ff

regeneration. He who desi7 es that the merit of Christ may be
beneficial to him, seelcs to be regenerated by tlte Spirit of Christ.
If any one should still urge, That to be propagated from
Adam, whence wrath and the penalty of death follows, is
common to all men3 why is it not in the same manner
stated, that to be regenerated by Christ, on which depends
our reconciliation and salvation, is common to all men?
To this Ι shall merely answer, That God himself was un-
