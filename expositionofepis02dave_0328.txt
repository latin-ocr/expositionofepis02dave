318 A DISSERTATroN ON THE DEATH OF CHRIST.

restrain it to the elect alone, confess notwithstanding that
its benefits extend to all that are called, yea, to all men if
they would believe; both sides seem to acknowledge a
twofold consideration of the death of Christ. For by both
of them it is regarded as an universal cause of salvation
applicable to all mankind individually if they should

If I should treat of the death of Christ under this twofold

an essential advantage thoroughly to understand on what
occasion they arose, by whom they were contested‚ in
what manner and how far they were agitated by the an-
tients. Let us therefore apply ourselves to a concise elu-
