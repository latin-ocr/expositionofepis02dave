then, not only the antient Fathers, but even the modern
Papists‚ confessing what we are endeavouring to demon-
strate, namely, That the death of Christ was so consti-
tuted by God to be an universal cause of salvation appli-
cable to all men, that at the same time, through some
special intention of him who offered and him who accepted
it, it is constituted a particular cause of salvation 10 be
infallibly and especially applied to all the elect, and to
them alone. See also Malderi Anti synod, p. 138.

TEsT. ll. Lasssy, our own Divines‚ who do not deny
that Christ suffered sor all, yet at the same time profess
that he redeemed the elect by his death in some peculiar
manner. Buoer expresses his opinion on these words,
(Matt. i. 21) He shall save his peopk, that is, the elect, whom‘
the Father brings to him. By his death he expialed the sins of
all the elect, and merited that the Fatlzer being propitious to
them should give them his Spiric. Here observe that Christ
by his death merited something for the elect, which he did
not merit for others : But what Christ merited for any one,
he merited according to the appointment and acceptance
of his Father: Therefore, according to the will and ap-
pointment of the Father, the death of Christ pertains to
the elect in some special way, in which it is not extended
to others. Masculus, who in his Common-places strongly
urges, that Christ is to be esteemed an universal Redeemer,
yet acknowledges a special intention of Christ concerning
the redemption of the elect, (on Rom. 8) where he says,
Thac Christ came into this world for the sake of the elect.
Which cannot be otherwise understood than that he came
into the world with a peculiar intention of infallibly saving
the elect. Which special intention of obtaining for the
elect the benefit of his passion to be applied to them, is so
far peculial· to them, that it is not extended to others,

this important subject, and the point upon which all difficulty turns, the
Editor would recomuiend to every ‹loubting mind the perusal of Scott's
Continuation of Milner, Vol. 11. chap. xiii.]-Vega wrote also a (Hammon-
