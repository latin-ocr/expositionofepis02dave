500 A DlSSERTAT¹0N oN THE DEATH or cunisr.

ofjuslice it is not given, in punishment qureceding sin, at
least of original sin. From all these things, we have what
we proposed to confirm in the first place, viz. That there is
no law decreed or appointed, by the merit of the death of
Christ, for administering the means of the grace of the
Gospel to the whole human race: but that God, notwith-
standing any respect to the death of Christ, may of right
deny, and actually has denied to some, even the call of
grace.

Secondly, from the same Fathers we shall shew, that
that grace, which we call by way of eminence the grace of
Christ, that is, which makes a man to be a living member
of Christ, and a partaker of salvation and eternal life, is
not prepared and offered, much less given to all by the
merit of the death of Christ, but is prepared and offered
and given to some, and is not prepared for or given to
others, and that according to the absolute good pleasure
of God. Augustine (Contr. duas epist. Pelag. lib. 2, cap.
2) says, According to the purpose of God one is called, another
is not called. To him who is called he gives gratuitously that
which is good ,· of which good, calling is che chief: to him who
is not called, he renders evil, because all are guilty, since by
one man sin entered into the world. From which words it
appears that calling according to purpose, which commu-
nicates saith and love, and places man in a state of salva-
tion, is given to some, and is denied to others. Moreover
it is also evident, that this grace is given to them to' whom
it is given, not on account of any special obedience of the
will of the person who receives it, but of the special
mercy of God, who calls and inclines the will to obedience.
It appears further, that the common guilt which all have
contracted in Adam, is enough to defend thejustice of
God in respect of those whom he passes by as to the gift
of saving grace, which even Bellarmin does not dare to
deny, as may be seen (lib. 20, de Grat. St lib. arb. cap. 4.)
A second testimony of Augustine is contained (lib. 4,
Contra duas epist. Pelag. 6,) He who makes men his sheep,
makes free the wills (ff men to the obedience (ff pictis· But
why he makes some men his sheep, and cloes noc make others, is
