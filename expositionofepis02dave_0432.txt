dation can be assigned, on which the truth of the afore-
said conditional declaration can rest. Therefore, it must
be acknowledged, That this evangelical covenant is uni-
versal from the ordination of God himself, and that it
equally regards all men individually.

If any one should object to this, that the Gospel
itself was never preached to all men, and therefore nei-
ther does the evangelical covenant embrace the whole hu-
man iace, or pertain to all men individually3 Ι answer,
That it does not follow,—-Because the evangelical cot-enam is
not ameounced to this nation, or that individual, therefore, it
was not made or established with regard to them. But this is
a legitimate conclusion, The evangelical covenant is not of
itself amzuncz'oble to that ηαίὶοη ον tlzis man ,· therefore, it does
not in any way pertaz‘n to them. Since there may be some
secret causes why the Gospel is not preached, which pre-
vent it from being announceable to all, which causes it is
not my present purpose to ascertain. We say, then, that
remissiori of sins through the death of the Redeemer might
have been truly announced in any age, to any nation, and
to any man, on condition of saith. Thus, in the time of
the old Testament, this covenant was revealed to Job, an
alien. So likewise in our own age, if a minister of the
Gospel should go to the Anfflpodes, he would not wait for
a new establishment of this conditional covenant, but
would at once announce it to them, taking for granted its
having been made in their favour. And hence it is that
the Apostle calls this word of the Gospel, the mystery which
hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now z's made
manifest, &a (Coloss. i. 26.) He acknowledged it, there-
fore, to have been established from eternity with the hu-
man race, although it was hidden or made manifest to one
or another, according to the good pleasure of God. See
Romans xvi. 25, 26, and Ephesians iii. 5 and 9. It remains
that by reason of this universal covenant, established
through the death of Christ, with the whole human race ;
we should shew, that we can affirm in a true and sound
sense, that Christ suffered or died for all men, which we
wish to dispatch in few words.
