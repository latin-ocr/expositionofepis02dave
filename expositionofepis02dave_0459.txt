proposition will be a refutation of both these errors.
Therefore we shall confirm it in the first place by testimo·-
nies of the Scriptures.

First. That remission of sins does not immediately flow
from the· passion of Christ to all men universally, without
some act of ours intervefflng, is proved by all those testi-
monies of the Scriptures which expressly require before-
hand the act of repentance. Such as Ezek. xviii. 21, [f
the wiclred will turnfrom all his sins that he bath committed,
&a he shall surely live, he shall not die. Luke xxiv. 46, 47,
Ic belloved Clu-ist to szffem aud to rise from the dead tlze third
day, and tlzczt repentance and remis-sion of sins should be
preaclzedz'n his name among all nations. l John i. 9, If we
confess our sins, he isfaz'thful andjust to forgive- us our sins,
and to cleanse us from all unriglzteonsnesS. From which it ·
appears, that although Christ died for all, yet 311 (10 not
immediately live through this death of Christ, but that all
live as soon as they repent: although remissiori of sins is
offered in the name of Christ, yet all men promiscuously
are not made partakers of this benefit, but the penitent
alone3 and by the same law, that repentance precedes re-
mission. And, although by virtue of the death of Christ,
God is bound to remit sins, yet it is in such a way, that
neither the faithfulness nor the justice of God requires that
this remissiori should be granted to any one, except on this
condition, If lze should confess his sins.

Secondly, The same is evinced by those passages which,
before we can be justified or reconciled to God, previously
require faith from us, as the instrument by which we ap-
prehend the grace of justification, and as the condition of
obtaining reconciliation‚ commanded to us in the Evange-
lical covenant. Of this kind are Acts xvi. 31, Belz'eve in
tlze Lorcl „lesus Christ, and thou slzalc be saved. John vi. 40,
This is the Father's will wlziclz laath sent me, that every one
which seetlc tlte Son, ancl believetlt on him, may lzave everlast-
ing life. John xx, 31, These are written tlzat με might be-
lieve, διο. and that believing, ye might lzave [ᾖε through lzis
name. Rom. iii. 22, lee rziglzteousness of God is, besfaz'tlz of
Jesus Christ, unco all and upon all them tlzat believe.- and
