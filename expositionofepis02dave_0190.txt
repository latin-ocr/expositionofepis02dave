which snclsed thee, although tlzyfatlzer may prostrate leimseff
across the threshold, proceed trampling upon thy parent, and
with tearless eye fi’eefortlz lo the hanner of the cross. It is the
genius of Pie& alone to he crnel in this mallen. It is lawful
therefore for sons to follow Christ even against the will of
their parents.

This Epistle, which was written by Jerome when a youth,
and more of a rhetorician than a theologian, is of no
great authority to determine a controversy of tlieology.
But yetl answer3 whatJerome says may be admitted, that
he must fly to the standard of Christ even by trampling*
upon parente, if he can no otherwise get thither: yet I
deny that the standard of Dominio or Francis is to be ap-
proached iu this manner. I add also, that children placed
under the power of their parentS, may follow Christ, al-
though they do not desert their parents. H, then, Jerome
would have the standard of Christ to be found no other-
wise than in a monastic life, we unliesitatingly reject Je-
rome as in error: if this be not his meaning, he affords
nothing for confirmation to Bellarmiu. And it is plain this
is not his meaning: for whereas Monasteries are for the
most part erected near cities and towns, Jerome calls Heli-
odorus into the desert, and expressly writes, Thac α monle
remaining in his own connlry cannot be perfect. Therefore‚
the Papistic Monasteries should be deserts, if the opinion
of Jerome is to be allowed.

I come to another testimony drawn from Jerome's epis-
tle 47. Jfany one should ‘reproachjeson that you are α Clu-is-
ticm, or thetyou are α virgin, andfor not caring to lzaveforsalcen
your'mother in order to live in α monastery among virgins,-
Qsou are not to regard it: such detraction z‘s your praise, that
&nehy is your-piely: for you prefer lzim ίο your mother whom
you are commanded to prefer to your own ig'fe.

Ι answer, We do not condemn the resolution to live a.
virgin in those to whom the gift of continence is given by
God3 neither do we even blame those, who, the better to
maintain this their resolution, flee as much as possible
from the world, and join themselves to those who follow
the same manner of life: But we deny that this virgin to
