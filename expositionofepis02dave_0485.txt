cial participation of the death of Christ. For the solution
of this difficulty we have brought forward this proposition
to be explained and confirmed, viz.

Tflsssm 4. The death of Christ being granted to be ap-
plicable‘to all men on condition offaith, it z's consistent wicfz
the goodness andjnstice <ff God to supply or to deny, eilber- to
nations m· to inclividuaks, tlze means of application, and that
according to tlte good pleasare ‘y‘ ln's own will, not according
to tlze disparity ‹ff'hmnan wz'lls. I shall premise a few things,
and then proceed to confirm the proposition. Fir-st, then,
it is to be observed‚ that those who are of a contrary
opinion think (Adver.Tilen. Corv. p. 403, and 109, 121,
158, l 19), Thac God is bound as it were by afiaed decree, and
appeared law, to grant tlze calent ‹ffgrace to those zolio rightly
use tlte taleni of natare. Secondly, they presume, Tleat'
every pagan, although dwellz'ng in tlte slzadow (ff death, is able,
by his own fiee will, to use tln's natural [alent well or, ill.

by degrees to a savz’ng knowledge of Christ ; bnt {flze zz-z'clcedly
abases tlzem, lze is cleservedly deprived af the knowledge (ff
C'lzrisl. Augustine seems to have been of a different opin-
ion (Libro de Nat. ἃ Grat. cap. 8 and 9) where he grants,
that the means os salvation ccnznot be applied (0 some insanis,
where also he acknowledges, {leat adnlls who have died in

We also affirm that there is no decree, no law, or promise
of God extant, according to which any one can certainly
conclude, This man has used the light of nature rightly or
less badly, therefore God will illuminate him with super-
natural grace. Arminius indeed says (Vide Armin. contra
Perk. p. 218,) that God has promised this in that sarsing of
Clu-est, To HIM THA'P ΗΛΤΗ SHALL BE arven. But much
more truly and learnedly the Reverend Bishop of Salisbury
