taining that all infants, whether elect or not elect, vvere
free from original sin, whom uevertheless he affirmed were
redeemed by the death of Christ. He extended, therefore,
redemption by the death of Christ even to those whom he
thought to be free from sin, as we said before: that is, he
declared that those were redeemed by the death of Christ,
who had no sins from which they could be redeemed. This
is the senseless doctrine which Augustine continually ex-
plodes, narnely, That through baptism the death of Christ
is applied to those who had no sin that could be expiate—d
by the death of Christ. The words of Pelagius himself
are, leo is so impiatis as to forbid to a. little iigf'aht of what-
ever age that redemption which is common to the haman race ,9
(De pec. orig. cap 19.) And the Council of Carthage, in
their Epistle to lnnocent (which is the uinetieth among
those of Augustine) relatos that Celestius had already
confessed in the Carthaginian Church, Thac the redemp-
tion even of little children was effectecl bl! the baptism (ff
Christ. (August. Epist. 59.) Now they who in words ad-
mitted the redemptiou of children, held notwithstanding,
(Contra. duas Epist. Pel-ag. 4. 2) That the same ihjimls (lo
not need the grace osche Saviour to deliver tlzemjrnm pcr-
dition, because they have not contracled any contagiohfrom
Adam which deserves danmation. They held, Thac baptism is
necessary for persons qs all ages, in order that the baptised
perso-n might be adopted as a son (ῃι (ἰοᾱ, not because he de-
rived from his parents any thing which could be erpiated in
the laver (ff regeneration; lu one word, Thac [he grace
of the Redcemer has in them what he mass adopt, not what
he may purify. <2 Hypognost. 5.) This, then, is the
first error attributed to the Pelagians about the death of
Christ, not that they affirmed that He suffered for all. as
some have thought3 nor that they denied that Ile suffered
for all, as others falsely pretend ; but because they dared
at the same timeto hold these two opposite doctrines, That
redemptioni through the death (ff Christ perlains to all men af
all ages: and, That insants are altogether sreefrom sin and
damnahle gnilt‚from which they could be redeemed. So much
for the first ‹rror of Pelagius.
