Vers. 11. Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circum-
cision nor zeneircumcisiou, Barbarian, Scythiam, hond
nor-free ‚· but Christ is all and in all.

The Apostle has excited the Colossians to renounce their
carnal and spiritual vices, by this argument chiefly3 that
they lzadput off' the old 'man and put on the new. l-Ie now
seems to polish aud point this very argument itself: l. By
(liscarding the salse opinion of those, who, neglecting this
renewing of themselves, confided in external privileges,
and despised those who were without them. 2. By substi-
tuting a true one, viz. that all external things which are
esteemed excellent and honoureble, avail nothing to salva-
tion without this renewal: on the other hand, what is es-
teemed vile and base, in no respect hinders it, because
Christ is all in all. Let us examine the words in their
order.

leere there is neither Greek 7107· Jew] That is, where
there is considered n‘o difference of nations in respect to a
new or renewed man, or the state of regeneration ς so that
any one should hope he is more acceptable to God because
heis aJew, or fear that he is despised because he is a
Gentile: Nay, If thou art a Jew, ancl art without this re-
newing‚ thou art a dog, and no son; if thou art a Gentile
and hast it, thou art a son, and no more a dog.

We thus prove it. The difference of nation does not
promote the salvation of any one if he be without sanctifi-
cation, nor hinder his obtaining it if he have it: we must,
therefore, seek after holiness. Hence it is that in the
Scriptures the pride of the Jews, who plumed themselves
on the privileges of their nation, is always rebuked. Thus
in Matt. iii. 9, Say not within yourselves, we have Abraham
to ourfather: and John viii. 39, to the Jews who boasted,
