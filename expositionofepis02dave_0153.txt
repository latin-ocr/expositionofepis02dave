the calendar of gods. Thai: there was a yearly custom of
the primitive church, to sing hymns in their assemblies to
Christ the Lord, is collected from that epistle of Pliny the
Second to the Emperor Trajan, which is still extant, Lib.
10. epist 97, in which he writes, that tlze (Jhrz'stians were ac-
customed on a particular day to meet before light. and to sing

opinion of Ambrose and Athanasius.

2. It is so to be performed, that they who hear may
from thence derive spiritual pleasure and edification.
Therefore, sarewell to all nugatory, and much more to im-
puresons: farewell to the superstitious bawlings of the
Papists‚ who bellow out psalms in their temples, but in an
unintelligible language, and with so much noise and tu-
mult, that if they should use a vernacular language, yet no
one would perceive what is sung by them.

3. In singing psalms it ought to be the especial care of
a Christian, that his heart be rightly ¹affected: they who
neglect this, may perhaps please rnen by au artificiul sweet-
