in the business of religion, and in those things which re-
gard her eternal salvation‚ to instruct his wife. For this
maxim is a sign of true love, to take care that his wife
may rightly worship God together with himself in this life,
whereby they may together enjoy God in the life to come.
On this account, Paul, in l Cor. xiv. 35, refers the wife to
the husband as to a domestic tut0r; Isclae wives would learn
any thing, let them ask their own husbands at home. There-
fore the husbands ought to direct their wives in things
earthly and secular; because they are co·partners in all
earthly things: they ought also to instruct them in divine
and heavenly things ; because they are co-heirs of heavenly
blessings, heirs together of tlte grace <ff lise, as Peter says,

The third and last effect of love is, to provide his wife

may conjecture what is to be thought of those monstrous
guttlers, who not only provide not for their family, but
dissipate the things which were well provided, in play, in
drinking, and harlots3 the wife and children in the mean
while pinched, and all but perishing for want and hunger.
Neither the love of the husband, nor the saith of the Chris-
tian appears in these things: for whom that which they are
wont to allege is no excuse, that they consume what is
their own3 for neither Divine nor human laws permit any
one to abuse his goods through lust. Resides, the wife
ought to be apartaker of all the goods which belong to
the husband, no less than she is compelled to be a parta-
ker in all his ills. And thus much of the three effects of
