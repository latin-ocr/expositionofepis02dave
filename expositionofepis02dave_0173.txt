love: which, the better to commend, we shall add a ne—
cessary cantion by way of appendage.

He who is desirous of performing his duty in loving his
wife, should beware of the vulgar error in choosing: Let
him think from the beginning in entering upon matrimony,
to choose, neither by the eyes alone, nor by thefingers atoue,
as Plutarch says, in Conjug. praecep.

They are said to marry by tlte eyes alone, who in choosing
a wife regard chiefly her external form and beauty. That
love, which rests upon so unstable a foundation, can in no
way be firm and constant. Neither do I so intend this
saying, as though it was unlawful to choose a modest wo-
man from her facet, (for we see the most religions and
chaste patriarch Jacob to have preferred Rachel to Leah)
but to be understood that external beauty is not especi- ⁴
ally, or by itself, to be sought after in marrying, but so
far as it is the beauteous dress of a beauteous mind.
Virtue is more agreeable where it appears in α beautiful person,
says Virgil, AEn. lib. v. l. 344. Therefore, let the first en·
quiry be as to manners ε If they are found to be good, and
worthy of commendation, then beauty should not be
slighted3 which is not improperly called by Tertullian, fe-
licit-y ofbody, an accession to the plastic hand (f tlze Divinity,
and tlze genteel apparel cffthe soal. The opinion of Solonion
in this matter is to be remembered, Prov. xxxi. 30, Favom· ek
decfflsal, and beazccy z’s vain ,· but a woman that fearetlz tlte
Lord, she shall be praised.

Now they are led into matrimony by thefingers, who only
regard what the wife shall bring in money; if the dowry
satisfies, they are little or not at all solicitous about pro-
bity or piety. These are worse than the before-mentioned ἰ
for they respect beauty‚ that is to say, the good in the
person; these, money, namely, the good apart from the
person. Therefore, the love of the former is light3 that of
the latter, plainly nothing: for they seek not a wife, but a
money-porter: after that they have laid their claws upon
the money, they regard not of a straw the porter. But it
is the character of the pious and the wise to prefer the

wife to the money, rather than the money without the wife;
