2. A minister of the word ought not only to shew hirn-
self a pattern of constancy and fortitude iu suffering, but
also to animate and strengthen others by buildiug up,
consoling, and preparing them by all means to endure the
cross with joy. Thus, in time past, Tertullian‚ Cyprian,

1. That brotherly love among all Christians ought to
be strong, but especially among ministers of the word. I
command you that ye love one (mollier, said our Lord. John
xv. 17. Ηο1100 says Tertullian, De patient. Love is the
chicfest hond of saith, (md the treasure of the Christian name.

2. They who bear hatred or envy towards their breth-
ren, especially towards fellow ministers, possess nothing
of the eandour of Paul, nothing of Christian charity: for
