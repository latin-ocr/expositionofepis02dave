8 AN EXPOSITJON OF s‘r. PAUL‘s Chal). iii.

with a constant reference to these supernal things : for this
is effectually to savour the things above, viz. to be so af·-
fected by their excellence and sweetness, as to thirst for
them with an insatiable desire, and refer all things to the
attainment of them. The Psalmist felt this love in his
beart, and well expressed it, Psal. xlii. 1, As the hartpant-
eth aster the water-broolcs, so panteth my soul after thee, Ο
God. Hence we may conclude, that all they who promise
themselves the happiness above, when, in the meanwhile,
they do not at all savour the things above, are delighted as
by a certain pleasing dream, and never will be satisfied
with those things, because they were never wont to thirst
or hunger for them at heart. The last branch of this ex·-
hortation remains.

Not on things on the earth ; supply, seelc and scmomu] The
Apostle calls all those things, in which the kingdom of God
does not consist, things of the earth ,- as riches, pleasures,
honours; and Iadd, in fine, those ceremonies and obser-
vations which centre in things earthly and corporea] :
for this hortatory conclusion being drawn from our death
and resurrection with Christ, it shews all those things to be
of no esteem. But now they are said to savom· (ff or seelc
earthly things, who place their happiness in these things,
who by these earthly blessings (as they are called) are in-
fluenced in all theirjudgments and decisions. These sen-
sualities are well depicted by the Apostle, in Phil. iii. 18,
19, Many walle, of whom I have told you (fleu, and now tell
you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of
Christ: whose eud is destruction, whose god is their belly, and
whose glory is in their shame, ὁι ’τὰ επίγεια φρονοῦντες, who mind
earthly things. They were men of this kind, whom our Sa-
viour censured in his parable, Luke xiV. because, while

⁴ they regarded fields‚ oxen‚ and wives, altogether neglected

the call of salvation.

Hence we may observe,
l. That no one can savour of things heavenly and

things of the earth at the same time. For if this could be

done, there would have been no need of this clause deny-
ing and forbidding it3 but it would lla-ve been sufficient to
