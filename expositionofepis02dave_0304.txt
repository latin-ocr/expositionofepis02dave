dadis, 2 Cor. xi. 28. For it behoves us to testify our de-
sire and love for all, at least by praying for them.

3. Although the Church of God is perpetual, yet the
household of the Church in particular places or countries,
is not certain, fixed, and perpetual. That is perceived from
hence, because these celebrated churches mentioned in
this place, have long since passed away.

4. Therefore we should avoid their example, lest
through contempt of the Gospel, or our lukewarmness, the
same should happen to us which God, having long since
threatened to these Asiatic Churches, it is plain has al-
ready done. For thus he addressed the Church at Ephe-
sus, Rev. ii. 4, 5, Thou hast left thyfirst love,· except thou

desirous of their’s before that of others. But it be-
hoves a people to be affected in this manner towards faith—
ful pastors: Let those wlzo ναῖε well, be accounted wortlzy qs
double honour, l Tim. v. 17.

2. Paul acted so seriously, that he might consult the
benefit of the Churches themselves. For the greater fa·
vour and veneration the teachers are in, the greater benefit
is wont to result to the hearers : for they willingly attend
to his instruction, of whose desire and love towards them-
selves they have no doubt.

3. Whilst he narrates the desire of Epaphras for the
welfare of these Churches, he thereby hoped, that he
