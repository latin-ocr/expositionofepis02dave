opposed to the opinions of the Arminians, who deny that
any antecedent will of God is the cause why some believe
rather than others, and are converted and effectually saved 3
and refer all this difference to the antecedent will of men,
who, when they are excited by grace common to others,
are willing beyond others to believe, to convert themselves,
to lay hold of salvation.

William Εεὶήιιεξκς formerly Professor in the Academy of
Douay‚ (in 1 Sentent. disp. 46, sec. 2, p. 222) says, We
ought not to imagine 2'71 God am( will, desire, ον endeavour, by
which lee wills‚ endeavours, strives, ond as sar as he can ef-

therefore follow, because the bad will of man resists his good
will, and through its prevaz'ling and lzindering, the will of God
isfrustrated. But this is almost all which some contend
was procured by the death of Christ, namely, that God,
by offering saviug grace to all men promiscuously, is willing
to save those who of their own accord apply themselves to

'³ WumAM Esrms, an eminentDutch divine of the Roman communion 3
he was born at Gorcum, in Holland, about 1542. After he had finished his
Classical studies at Utrecht, he studied Divinity and Philosophy at Lou-
vain, where he taught those studies for ten years; and afterwards became
Professor of Divinity in the University of Douay, was subsequently elected
to the Chaucellorship‚ and died there in 1613. He was equally distinguished
for his learning, modesty, and benevolence. Of his numerous works, the
following are most known, viz. 1. Commentariz z‘n quatuor libros Sententiarum.
Douai, 1615. 4 tomis, fol. Du Pin says that this is one of the best theo-
logical works of which the Roman Church can boast. 2. Annotationesin
praecipua difficiliora Scriptura> loca, Antverpiae, 1621, folio: of this work,
which appears to have been highly estemned, there were several Editions.
3. In omnes B. Pauli ct aliorum Apostolorum Epistulas Commentario. Douai,
1614, 2 tomis, folio. Du Pin commends this as one of the best works of the
kind; but it appears that Estius was prevented by death from proceeding
further than 1 John v., and that the rest of the Commentary was supplied
by Bartholomew De la Pierre. (Vide Cltalmcrs's Biographical Dirlionary,
and Mor-cri.)
