260 AN ExPOSl'l'loN OF ST. PAUL's Chap. iv.

he seems especially to have respect to that converse which
is held with infidels and pagans, yet he has respect also
generally to whatever discourse Christians have with one
another.

Instructions.

1. Itis not sufficient to order our life and actions well,
unless we at the same time regulate our words and dis-
course religiously. For Christians must not only live, but
speak according to rule. If any one among you seem to be
religious and bridletlz not ln‘s longae, that man's religion is vain,
Jas. i. 26. Therefore away with that excuse plainly of a
licentious poet,

We have α wauton escutclzeon, but α chaste life.
Neither the life nor conversation is allowed to be indecor-
ous in pious men.

2. Not only is there danger of guilt and damnation
from wicked actions, but it is also incurred from wicked
speeches3 because we are bound to useful speech and sea-
soned with grace3 as shall be shewn presently. And
hence the Apostle calls a wicked tongue an unruly evil,
and declares that it is full of deadly poison, Jas. iii. 8.
Deatlz and life cere in tlze power of the longae, says solomon,
Prov. xviii. 21. Chrysostom, Hom. 2, in Matt. observes,
that most men bring injury upon themselves by their
tongues. And Cyprian, lib. 1, epist. 3, notes, that among
all the parts of that rich man concerning whom we have a
parable in Luke xvi„ the mouth and the tongue suffered
the most bitter torinents, because he had sinnecl more with tlze
longae and tlte mouth.

3. Itis the mark of a perfect and complete Christian,
to manage his discourse and his tongue rightly. Hence,
after the injunction concerning perpetual prayer and a vvise
conversation, the Apostle subjoins, in the last place, as
the height of perfection, the government of the tongue:
For, says he, if any one qffend noc in word, the Same is a
peoefecc man, and able also lo brielle the whole body. James
iii. 2. Ye thus have what it is which is to be regulated.

But for how long must we employ this care of our
speech?
