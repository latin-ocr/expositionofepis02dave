believe. And this is that special application of the merits
of Christ, which we affirm pertains to the elect by some
peculiar privilege, from the special will of Christ in offer-
ing himself, and of God the Father in accepting this sa-
crifice. Scotus had respect to this in his saying, which is
most worthy of observation‚ That this was tlze priucipal
thing in the merit (gf Christ, that he merited that those
should be united to him who had not been so before (lib.
3, dist. 19, qu. l, p. 75). Which is the same as if he had
said, that the chief efficacy of the merits of Christ con-
sisted in this, that he merited, that some of those who be-
lieved not should actually become believers, and, being
united to Christ by saith, should obtain eternal life. This
is that special ordination and application of the merits of '
Christ, which altogether depends on the good pleasure of
God, and not on the free-will of men.

accepting that sacrifice, there was some special intention
of quickening and infallibly saving all the elect, by the

Testament, after Christ was really exhibited and offered on
the cross. For as, from the special intention of God, spe-
cial grace is derived to the elect under the New Testament‚
on account of the merit of this sacrifice now actually of-
fered 3 so, from the special will of the same God, special
grace flowed to the elect under the Old Testament on ac-
count of the merit of the sacrifice afterwards to be offered.
For Christ was α La‘mb slainfrom thefoundation oftke world
both in the preparation of his own will, and in the accep-
tance of the will of the Father. It is, therefore, here to
be observed, that there is one kind of cause which ope-
