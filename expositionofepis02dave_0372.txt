also l'or those who continue in unbelief through their own
fault, and thus oventually are condemned, then itmust be
confessed that this death of Christ is a remedy from the
nature of the thing, and the ordination of God, applicable
to all: But such was the counsel and will of God3 which
is evinced from the Divine promises, which make known
his will to us. For God has promised salvation, under the
condition of faith and repentance, even to those who
would never perform those conditions. , Thus remission is
promised to Cain, ifhe should repent. Gen. iv. 7. Which
salvation, or remissiori of sins, conditionally promised to
such a person, clearly proves that a cause of salvation was
procured and applicable to the same person, under the
aforesaid condition. The same is evinced in that God in
the work of redemption hath so ordered his counsel that
no man can truly complain that he perished through a
defect in the expiatory sacrifice. But he to whom the
death of Christ is not applicable for salvation as a re-
medy according to the will of God, may not less truly
affirm that a sacrifice was wanting for him, than for the
wicked angels, for whom under no condition is the death
of Christ ordained. And this is that counsel which the
Pharisees are said to have despised. Luke vii. 30.

destined by God for the good of the human race before
it can be understood for whom saith was destined, then it
is necessary to consider it as a cause of salvation appli-
cable to all before it be determined that it is applied or
infallibly to be applied to this or that person. The argu-
ment of the consequence is this, That it is understood
that the death or merit of Christ is not applied, nor to be
applied to any one, until it is presupposed that saith is
granted or to be granted to him. And on the contrary,
the death of Christ is considered to be applicable to any
one, before it is conceived that faith is denied or to be
denied to him for ever. Now l add the minor, namely,
