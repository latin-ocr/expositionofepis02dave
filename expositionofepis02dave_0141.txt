Ver. 16. EP¹STLE To 'rim corossmns. 131

may also be called tlze word qf Christ for the same reasons.
For before his incarnation, Christ, by his Spirit, inspired
the patriarchs and prophets3 as it is said 2 Pet. i. 21, lee
prophecy. came not in old time by tlte willof maim buc holy
men (ff God spake as they were moved by tlte Holszs (iliost.
Yea, the Λογος itself was the eternal Son of God, who
under the old Testament appeared to Moses, and instructed
and established him in sacred things3 as Tertullian con-
tends, De Trin. Advers. Jud. Advers. Marcion, et alibi.
Moreover, the Scriptures of the Old Testament no less
than those of the New, speak and testify concerning Christ:
This the Saviour asserts concerning the Old Testament,
Searclz the Scriptures ; for they are they which testifis of me,
John v. 39. Therefore, the object of this our study is the ι
whole word of God3 because the whole word of God is the
word (ff Christ.

2. We must observe the mode of exercise in this study
of the Scriptures: which the Apostle most fully expresses
in three words ε

Ἐνοικείτω, Let it dwell inyou] that is, Do not suffer the
word of God, as a stranger, to stand without3 but let it
enter into the chamber of your beart, and constantly
abide in your niinds, no otherwise than as domestics dwell
in the house3 yea, let it be no less known and familiar to
you, than they are wont to be who dwell with you.

Πλουσίως. νὶσΙιζιχ, 01 abundantly] that is, Do not only 01111
501116 little particle, but turn ovcr the whole Scriptures,
prophets‚ apostles, evangelists3 in a word, receive the
whole doctrine revealed from heaven. Resides, admit the
whole within you 3 into the mind, the memory, the affec-
tions, the life: 111 fine, let there be no part of you in which
the word of God does not dwell.

Ἐν πασῃ σωφια, in all wisdom] that is, If ye apply to the
word of God, that from thence ye may seek and learn all-
saving wisdom3 namely, perfect knowledge, as well of the
things to be believed, as of those to be done, in what is
ordained for life eternal. This, then, is to be the aim of
our study, that we be instructed in all saving wisdom out
of the storehouse of the Scriptnres.
