diator, yet you could never so separate these, as that the
passion of Christ, which was specially offered and ac-
cepted for them, should not be the cause of preparing and
giving to those elect persons both effectual grace and sal-
vation. Since, therefore, both these opinions are the same
for our purpose, we shall dismiss the discussion of a thing
so very unnecessary, and propose and confirm one thesis
only respecting the death of Christ as limited by some
special consideration to the predestinated alone; which is
as follows,

The death os Christ, from the special design ‘ff God the
Father, who from eternity ordaz'ned and accepted that sac-ri-

that, by his eternal foreknowledge‚ he foresaw that some
would believe, and some would remain in unbelief, and
then at length destined to believers, as such, an effectual
application of the death and merits of Jesus Christ. But
we think, that, in predestination to faith, the application
of the death of Christ was infallibly destined for some cer-
