life to be obtained through Christ may be promised to
them, under the condition of faith. We shall therefore
briefly shew,

TninnLY, Thac this condition offoith, which is required
in order that the death (ff Christ, which was endareclfor all,
may be applied to any person individually, neither is, nor ought
to be conceived by us to be altogether impossible to any person
living. This, however, is to be remembered, that from the
beginning we have inculcated, that this possibility is
founded on the supernatural assistance which may possibly
be received by any one, while he is in the land of the liv-
ing, according to that celebrated saying of Prosper of
Aquitain (Object. Vincent. Resp. 6), There is this dfference
between wiched men ond devils, that for men, however wiclced‚
α reconciliation is provided, if God should have compassion. .
upon them ; bnt for devils there is no conversion reserved at all.

material power, as it is called, because God may effect in
any one that he should be converted and believe the Gos-

as Aquinas has well observed, namely‚ either by the power
which is in us, as we say thot a stone can be moved downwards ;
or by power considered on the part of another, as we say that
α stone con be movecl upwards, not by its innate power, but by
the power ‘ff the person who throws it. Quaest. disp. De
Praed. art. resp. ad 7. According to this mode we
affirm that any living person can believe, or that the
condition of faith is possible to any one who is in the
land of the living, not by any innate power resident in
himself, but by the supernatural assistance which can be
supplied by God at any timeto any man, according to the
saying of John the Baptist (Luke iii. 8), Ι say unto you,
that God is able of these stones to raise up children unta Abra-
ham. Therefore there is no heart so obdurate and stony,
that it cannot be softened by God, and be turned to saith
and repentance. This is what A ugustine signified in other
