ficial or effectual application of the merits of Christ de-
pends on the grace of predestination‚ by which saith antif
magam dn will is mercifully confened upon some, though‘ r ”
“jothers by the justjudgment of God. As to Pela-
gius, that he transferred the benefit of the death of Christ,
that is, eternal life, from the special intention of God, to
the special operation of the human will, appears from the
epistle of Prosper to Augustine. It appears also from the

express testimonies of the Fathers‚ and of modern writers,
who assign to the predestinated a special prerogative in
the death of Christg which is nothing else than an infalli-

appointinent of God, derived from the merit of Christ in
