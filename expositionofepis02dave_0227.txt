labours themselves, or the duties of servants and masters,
which are different and plainly the reverse : but it refers to
the mind and the manner of actin23 which in each ought
to be equal by a certain proportionate analogy. For in-
stance‘3 Servants are commanded to obey their masters in
singleness of heart and the sear of God : now masters give
them that wlziclz is equal when they rule them piously
and religiously. Servants are commanded to obey their
masters from the heart and with good will : masters repay
them for their services, when they rule their servants with
mildness and a sort of paternal affection. Therefore, that
we may bring the difference of these wordsjust and equal
in this place, under a brief view : That is calledjzest which
the law requires, or what is due to servants ‚from legal ob-
ligation: that is called equal which Charity and Christian
lenity requires, or what is due to them from moral obliga-
tion. Of this equz'ty or equabz'lity, these are the especial
duties:

1. To esteem a servant as a partaker of a like nature,
and moreover of the same grace3 not to look down upon

although master and servant are words expressive of a dis-

a noble and sacerdotal family, and pre-eminent among his contemporaries
sor his talents‚ eloquence, and wisd0m3 and equally as well versed in the
doctrines of the Greek Phiiosophers, as in the peculiar tenets of his own
people. The partiality which he felt for the Platonists, seems indeed to
have caused much confusion in his mind, through his attempts to amalga-
mate their philosophy with the M‘osaic laws and institutions, and renders it
difficult to decide how far his opinions preponderated in favour of either.
lt has been thought that he embraced Christianity before his death ; but
the evidence for this assertion does not appear to be sufficient ε for though
living about our Saviour's time, and probably for some years after his cru-
cifixion, yet there is no reason to believe that he ever visited Judea. Still,
as he visited Rome, first in the reign of Caligula, to defend the cause of
the Alexandrian Jews, who had been charged with disaffection to the Ro-
man sovereignty—-and again in the time of the succeeding emperor, he
might have learnt something of the important events transacting in that
