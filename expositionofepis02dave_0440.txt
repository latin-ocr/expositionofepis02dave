words, when he wrote, To be able to havejaith is in the na-
ture of men, but to have grace is peculim¹ to believers. (De
Praedestinat. Sanctor. cap. 5.) To this also Augustine al-
luded in his Soliloquies (lib. ii. cap. l,) where, when he
had said, We would believe, ff ic were in our power, he af-
terwards subjoins, Oar power is God himself.

Secondly‚ When we refer this possibility of having saith
to the active power of God, and to the receptive power of
man, this is to be understood not only of the absolute
power of God, but of his ordinary power. For among
Divines some things are said to be possible by the abso-
lute power of God, and some things by his ordinary power.
lt will not be foreign to our purpose to make this distinc-
tion, when we have explained it in a few words. That,
then, is said to be possible by the absolute power of God,
which, from the nature of the thing, does not involve a
contradiction if it should be done 3 that, on the other
hand, impossible, which does involve a contradiction.
And under this consideration, as Thomas rightly says,
(Part. qu. 25, art. 3‚) Whatever can have a mamzer of being
is reclcoued among these absolute possibles, but among the impos·
sibles, what cannot have a manner (ff being: assor instance,
whatever implies in itsels that it both is and is not, at the same
time. That such things are not subject to Divine Omnipo-
tence, does not argue any defect in God. Because, as
there is no defect in visual power because it does not apply
to that which is not visible, so neither is there a defect in
absolute power because it is not extended to that which is
not possible. It is sufficient therefore for establishing the
omnipotence of God, that it can do whatever is possible to
be done. But of those things which are otherwise, z‘t is
more properly said, that such things cannot be done, than that
God cannot do such things. For this some refer to Luke i.
37, With God nothing shall be impossible, that is, whatever
can be conceived, even implying a contradiction to what
may be supposed by any person, that can be done by God.
Therefore the rule of judging what God can do of his ab·
solute power ought to be taken fron] the thing itsels3 be-
cause where there is not a defect of impossibility on the
