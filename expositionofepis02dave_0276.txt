266 AN EXPOSiTlON or ετ. PAUL’s Chal). iv.

employed to commend two distinguished men, by whom
this Epistle was transmittcd to the Colossians. how three
things are to be considered in these as it were commenda-
tory letters ε
l. The persons sent3 namely, Tychious, and Onesimus.
(l. To make the affairs of Paul
known to the Colossians.
2· The Ofillsses Of the 2. To know and look into the

miSSiOD 3 affairs of‘the Colossians.
ι 3. To comfort the hearts of the
k Colossians.
3. The commendatioris of the Missionaries:
Of Tychicus; which are opened in the 7th

 

verse.
Of Onesimus3 which are opened in the 9th
verse.

We must begin with the persons3 and first with Ty-
chicus: He was of Asiatic origin, and clave to Paul as his
companion in passing through Macedonia, and afterwards
preceding him, he awaited him at Troas, Acts xx. 4. In
the Synopsis which passes under the name of Dorotheus,>lg
he is said to have been the first Bishop of Chalcedon.
But the credit of this must rest with this author. It is
certain and clear, that he was a pious man, and endowed
with remarkable gifts, and employed the same to propa·
gate the Gospel and edify the Church.

* Dono-ruens flourished A.D. 303, according to Cave (Hist. Lit. Tom.
1, pp. 163. Ed. 1740), a very obscure person, of whom, therefore, the
more is said. And first, he is not some other persons who have borne his
name. Then the Roman and Greek martyrologies have decorated him with
more honours than he deserves. He is said to have written many Ecclesi-
astical Commentaries, and particularly Synopsis de vita et morte Prophetarum,
Apostolormn, et Discipulormn Domini, contained in the Bibliotheca Pan-mn ,· of
the fabulosity of which Cave was convinced by a Greek fragment sent him
by his friend Dodwell, and which is given at length, occupying five pages‚
with about two of commentary by the Literary Historian. The writer of
the fragment asserts that Dorotheus wrote in Latin, and that Ιισ translated
the work into Greek· Cave thinks it wonderfully probable, that a Greek,
and a Bishop of Tyre, in Phoenicia‚ should write in Latin! In fact, it
almost appears, that, although a Latin and a Greek work are extant and
visible enough, the alleged author may be classed with the Entz'a, not
Rationis, but Inwginalionis.
