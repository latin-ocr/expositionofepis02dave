the filth of superstition and lusts. It is also not less ma-
nifest, to how many the Gospel was never revealed, who
lived less wickedly· Who is ignorant that among the phi-
losophers, Socrates, Plato, Xenophon3 and among the
Romans, Fabricius, Scipio, Cato, made a good use of the
light of nature beyond other men? yet none of these on
that account became a partaker of the grace of the Gos-
pel. Therefore the reason of the Gospel and snpernatural
light being given οι· denied, is not to be sought in the
better or worse use of the light of nature, but in the good
pleasure of God, who calls or not as it pleases him. These
things being disposed of, let us proceed to the proposition
itself: which we confirm, in the first place, 'oy an argu-
ment derived from the death of Christ, from whence our
adversaries think that they can infer the contrary.
ARGUMENT l. If by the death of Christ a covenant
was established, according to which remission of sins is
promised to every one that believeth, but no covenant was
established according to which the Gospel is promised to
any heathen who uses his natural endowments rightly, or
no ways badly, then, the death of Christ being admitted,
it is rash to conclude that God is bound by his faithful-
ness, or goodness, or justice, or any other covenant, to re-
veal to men the mystery of the grace of. the Gospel on ac·
count of a better use of nature. But it is most certain,
that such a covenant no where exists. Therefore a revela—
tion, or a denial of the Gospel, depends on the good plea-
sure of God, who withholds or reveals it as it seems good
to himself, and not on account of the different kInds of
actions of men. We prove the major thus: that God
is bound to no man, and owes no man any thing, except
of his own gratuitous and voluntary promise. leo lwtlz
