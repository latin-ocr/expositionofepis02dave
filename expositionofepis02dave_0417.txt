Clzap. iv. THE secono PROP081T10N s‘rATssn, διο. 407

that gratuitous assistance sufficient to produce the act of
believing is given to all, since the Scripture itself teaches‚
in a manner sufficiently clear, that saith is the special gift
of God. This, therefore, is disallowcd, since, with the
most learned Bannesius (in Quest. 23, Ars. 3 Concl. 8)
we found the possibility of performing this condition
neither on any natural and innate gift, nor on a supernatu-
ral gift received by all 3 but in a supernatural gift to be re-
ceived possibly by any living person, according to ordi-
nary law, as the Schoolmen observo. These things being
thus expounded and deterniined, Ι will now divide the
aforesaid proposition into three parts, which Ι will confirm
separately by the reasons to be alleged.

First. lee mere snfficz‘enczs of the death of Clzrise, which
is estimated only by the intrinsic vulne of this ransom, without·
tlzszt ordained snfficiency which arises from the intention and
act qf'offering, is not sofar (tvailable that Clu-ist may be trnl-sy
said to leave died sor all men snfficiently. I have thought ‘that
this proposition should be laid down for the sake of those
who strenuously maintain that Christ died for the elect
alone, and yet (which Ι confessI am too dull to under-
stand) admit that Christ died for all sufficiently, and some-
times greatly exaggerate this sufficiency as extending itself
to all mankind. They profess, indeed, that Christ diedfor
all rnen, for all orders, states, ancl kinds of men, yea alsofor
individnal persons as lo the szgfficiency (ff his merz'ts. (Contra
rem. Collat. p. 104, .& Status Controv. p. 144.) The Vete-
ranici, in theirjudgment exhibited to the Synod of Dort,
write thus (Acta Synod. Dordr. p. 99) When Clzrist is said
to have diedsor all, this may be understood of (he snfficiency
