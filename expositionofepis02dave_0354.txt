344 A nissi-:RTATmN oN THE DEATH or cnr-mr,

clared applicable for salvation to every man, and the
manner or condition of the application is at the same time
shewn in those words, that whosoever believeth in him should
not perislz. From this testimony we incontrovertibly con-
clude, that the death of Christ by the ordination of God
is applicable to every man, and would be applied if he
should believe in Christ. Shew me an individual of the
human race to whom the minister of the Gospel may not
truly say3 God bath so loved thee, thal lze gave his only be-
golten Son, that if thou shouldest believe in him, thou skalt
not pet-ish but have everlastireg life. This, on the certainty
of his believing, might be announced to any individual.
Therefore the death of Christ is applicable to every man
according to this will and ordination of God. I know that
some learned and pious Divines‚ by the world here under-
stand the world, or whole body of the elect, and rely on
this argument, that it is said, the Son qs God was given.
that wlzosoever helien-eth in him should not perislz: and the
elect alone are they who so believe in Christ that they
should not perish‚ but have everlasting life. ButI answer‚
that nothing else can be inferred from hence, than that the
death of Christ brings salvation eventually to the elect
alone, and is actually applied by means of saith: but it
cannot be inferred that it was not a remedy applicable to
others, and by the ordination of God to be applied, if they
should believe. W'e will illustrate this by a case in some
measure parallel. Suppose that all the inhabitants of a cer-
tain city laboured under some epidemic and mortal dis-
ease3 that the King sent to them an eminent physician fur-
nished with a most efficacious medicine, and caused it to
be publicly proclaimed, that all should be cured that were
willing to make use of this medicine. Doubtless we might
truly say of this king, that he so loved that city, as to
send his own most skilful physician to it; that all who
were willing to attend to his advice, and take his medicine,
should not die, but recover their former health. But if
any should object that this physician was sent only to
those who should follow leis prescriptions, and that his
medicine was applicable by the appointrnent of the king
