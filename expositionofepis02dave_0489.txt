ever wicked, and covered with all kind of iniquities. We
ought not, therefore, to give a reason, from the difference
of men or their works, why the Gospel and the knowledge
of Christ is obtained by some and not by others3 bnt to
acquiesce in the good pleasure of the Divine will 3 accord-
ing to the Apostle, (2 Tim. i. 9) He hath called us with a
holy calling, not according to our worm, but according to his
own purpose and grace, which was given vs in Christ Jesus,
before the world began. But still it may be pretended‚
Although God is not bound either by debt, or by any pro-
mise confirmed by the death of Christ, to reveal Christ to
them that make a good use of the light of nature, yet since
of his grace he is accustomed to give to men many things
which he had not promised3 what should hinder us from
saying that he has this as his common way of distributing'
the grace of the Gospel, that he grants it to those who
make a better use of the light of nature, and does* not

But avellier, enslaved to lust, and covered with wiclcedness, is
so overruled by God, that he hears, believes, and is saved.
We say then that all men, from their bad use of nature,
render themselves unworthy of the Gospe13 and that God,
in communicating or deny-ing the Gospel, is not accus—
tomed to weigh the degrees of human worthiness and un-
worthiness‚ and from thence to derive his common rule of
bestowing or not bestowing graee; but sometimes denies
it to those who have not made good use of the remains of
nature, and in the mean time grants it to those who have
abused them much worse: and sometimes does the con-
