396 Α DissER'rATioN ΟΝ THE DEATH OF CHRlST·

OBJECTION 15. Means wisely destined do not exceed
their adequate end. But the adequate end of the death of
Christ is the salvation of the elect. Therefore the death
of Christ has no ordination to any persons whatever who
are not elected. Therefore it is falsely stated to be appli-
cable to all men by the ordination of God.

REPLY 15. Ι acknowledge that the infallible salvation
of the elect is, in subserviency to the glory of God, a cer-
tain special and most excellent end, for the obtaining of
which the death of Christ was destined3 but I deny.that it
was the only or sole end. For God sent his Son into the
world, and willed that he should die, not only that he
might effectually save the elect, but also that remission of
sins and eternal life might be brought to and also conferred
upon mankind generally in the Gospel, if they should be-
lieve. But it is not understood that this general or condi·
tional covenant is confirmed, unless the death of Christ is
presupposed to be applicable to all men according to the
ordination of God, and actually to be applied to any one
as soon as he should have believed. This end the Scrip-
ture hath clearly indicated in many places3 in John iii.
14, 15, As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even
so must the Son of mem be [fied up, that wlzosoever believetlz
in him should not perz'slz, buc have eternal lise. And John vi.
40, leis z's the will of him that sent me, that every οηε wlzz'clc
seetlz tlte Son and heliecetlz on him may lzave ever-lasting lffe.
And Acts x. 43, To stim give all tlze prophets witness, that
{ln-ouglz leis name u-hosoever bellet-eth in him slzall receive re·
mission of siris. I omit other passages. From these it will
sufficiently appear, that although not all, but only the elect
believe, God specially softening their heartS, yet that the
death of Christ was so offered to God the Father by the
Son, and is so indiscriminately offered by God the Father
to mankind, and is so announced promiscuously to all by

the ministers of the Gospel, that any one may collect from
thence that there is a kind of firm and stedfast ordination

of God, according to which the death of Christ may per-
tain to all men. This ordination the non-elect render nse-
