who live in remote churches, need our assistance. For to
salute one by word as a brother, and, when occasion offers,
not to promote the welfare of a brother, is the work of de-
rision rather than of love.

Am] Nymphas] Now he joins a special salutation, on
account of the special and distinguished piety of this man,
as may be gathered from the following verses. For it is
right to assign extraordinary honour to those, whose virtue
appeared and shone in the Church surpassing all others.

In the Commentaries which pass under the name of Am-
brose‚ a comical error has found its way: For they have
transformed this pious and renowned man into a woman:
For thus he is there treated of3 He esteems Nymphas more

said to have been so devoted, tlzat her whole house was marked

probable that any wise man would, by painting this sign
of the cross through his whole house, openly betray him-
