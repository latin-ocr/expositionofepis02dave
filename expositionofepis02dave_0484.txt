474 A nissssizTATioN oN Tne DEATH OF eumer.

of those who extend this universal efficacy of the death of
Christ which we defend, further than the truth of the thing
permits. For there are some who, because the death of
Christ, in the sense aforesaid, is affirmed to have been im-
posed for the human race, for themselves and all mankind
individually, immediately infer, that it is now incumbent
on the Divinejustice and goodness, that he should admi-
nister the means necessary for producing saith to all for
whom he thus gave Christ to death. But because it ap-
pears more clearly than mid-day light, that to heathens
and pagens, upon whom the light of the Gospel never
sbone, means were not given which immediately suffice to
produce faith in them, they resort to an assertion‚ that suf-
ficient means were always given even to such persons, by
which they might be led mediately, and, as it were, by de-

in the woods shouldfollow the dictate of natural reason in llze
desire os good and tlte avoiding of evil, it is most certainly to
be believed that God will either rem-l to him by inter-nal inspi-
ration those things which are necessary to be believed, οι· will
direct to him some preaclier (ff tlzesczz'clz. The opinion, there-
fore, of those persons amounts to this, that they think
that God, by the efficacy and merit of the death of Christ,
is now bound, as it were by a statute law, to supply suffi-
cient means to all, by which they may be led to Christ, if
they should be willing3 so that on the part of God nothing
is wanting that they should not obtain saith and a benefi-
