Not dissimilar are the remarks brought forward in answer
to the ninth objection of the Gallicam Divines. For there
it is confessed, although Christ may be said to have been
cracffied for those only wlzom lzis death profiled, that is, for
the regenerate‚ and those that believe to the end, it may
also be said, that the Redeemer of the world gave leis own
blood sor tlte world, and tlte world would not be redeemed.
Lastly, it clearly proves that Augustine did not teach that
Christ died for the predestinate alone, because Prosper
from his opinion extends the peculiar benefit of llis pas-
sion, namely, the remissiori of original sin, to infants
even not predestinated. (Resp. ad obj. 2 Gall. ὃς Sentent.
2.) He who says, that the grace of baptism being received
does not take mvay original sinfrom tlzose wlzo are not predes-
tinceted to life, is not α ΟαίΙιοΙίε. Which opinion was em·
braced by the Synod of Valenee* even some ages after

Papists of more modern times—broached their quibbles against Augustine,
or rather their distortions of his sentiments. Vide Reeves's Translation and
Notes, and Cave's Historia Literaria.

¹* This Synod‚ or Council‚ as it is termed by Du Pin, was beldin the
year 855, by the management of Remi, Bishop of Lyons, in order 'to con-
firm his opinions about Grace. It was composed of 14 Bishops of the Pro-
vinces of Lyons, Aries, and Vienne, in which the three Metropolitans pre-
sided, and Ebbo, Bishop of Grenoble, was present. They made 6 Canons
in this Synod concerning Grace, Free-will, and Predestination. They re-
jected four Canons made at the preceding Council of Quiercy, held under
Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims, on the doctrine of Predesfflnation, as
idle, vain, and false ; and condemned a Treatise of Scotus on the same sub-
ject, as a silly book. Hincmar afterwards wrote a treatise of thirty-eight '
Chapters, which he dedicated to Charles the Bald, to defend his four Arti-
cles, and confute the Canons of the Council of Valence. In this treatise
he sets out with a view of the origin of the heresy about Predestination‚
and to prove that it commenced after the time of Augustine. Thus muci}
for the boasted Unity of the Church of Rome at this period.
