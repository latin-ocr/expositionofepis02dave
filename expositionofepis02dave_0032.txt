22 AN ExposlTloN OF sr. PAUL’s Cleap. iii.

lies hid in Christ; nay, the streams of spiritual life are not
derived to US, except so far as we are joined to Christ, in
whom this life is laid up. I live, says the Apostle, yet not
I, but Clzrist livetlz in me, Gal. ii. 20. Hence is that decla-
ration John xv. 5, 6, [f a man ahide not in Christ and Christ
in him, heis castfortlz as a branch, and is withered. But our
life of glory is also hid in Christ. For as the life of the
branches is not extinct iu the season of winter, but is hid·
den in the root of the vine itself: so the blessed and glo-
rious life of the faithful is hidden and reserved in Christ,
the spiritual vine, in this season of their earthly pilgrim-
age. Nay, and we also are said, in this sense, to be al-
ready put into possession of this celestial life, namely, as
we are already raised to heaven in Christ the Head‚ and
endued with eternal life and immortality. This is what the
Apostle would have us to understand in Ephes. ii. 6, He
luuh, raised us up together with him, (md made us sit together
‘in heavenly places in Clu-ist Jesus. In Christ, therefore, as

hath bestowed on us, l John v. ll. It is hidden, lastly,
in the man Christ, as in the efficient, that is to say, the
secondary and instrumental cause. Moreover all superna-

ley gives the following; which is here copied for the sake of the impressive
remark subjoined to it, and its suitability to the tenor of our Expositor's
observations :-‘⁶ leo shall cause tlte fuslcz'on of our body of humiliation to be

made like unlo his body of glor-y, according to the energy of ms power of subduz'ng
all things io himseffi--This transformation of the bodies of the faithful, by the

power of our Lord, requires a previous transformation of the mind to a re-
semblance of him, by saith in his word, by reliance on his nominent, by
conformity to his p1·eceptS‚ and imitation of his example. For he mathath
this hope in him, of being transfimued into the likeness of his Loul, of
seeing him as he now is, and of standing for ever in his presence ; he that
hath this hope ⁶ purif-leth himself even as He is μαι-α’ ”
