Chap.iv. THE SEcoNn PROPOSITION ετΑΤΕο, διο, 405

phet Isaiah (liii. 10), When thou slzalt make Iris soal cm offer-
z'ngfor sin, he shall see his seed,- and is explained by the
Apostle, Heb. viii. 10, This is the covemmt tleat l wid make
with the house cf Israel ,· After tlzose days, saitlz the Lord‚ I
will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their
laeam, and I will be to tlzem α God, and they shall be to me
apeople, &Q As if he should say, That Christ by his
death not only established that conditional covenant
which may be published to all men individually in this
form, If thou slzalc believe, whosoever thou art, thou skalt be
saved through tlze death of Christ, but also that secret and
absolute covenant concerning the giving of faith to certain
persons and infallibly saving them through Christ and for
his sake. But it is to be observed, That this latter cove-
nant is known to Christ alone, nor can it be opened to any·
one by the ministers of Christ, as to the individualper-
sons whom it embraces. For the Apostles themselves
could, and we can preach to every man that conditional
and revealed covenant, [f thou skalt believe, thou skalt be
saved. But neither could they, nor can we promise infal-
libly to any one, leoa arc one of those whom God gave to
Christ the Mediator, and to whom, through Christ mzdfor lzz‘s
sake, he will give perseverz'ngfaith, and will itffallibly lead to
eternal lffe. For this would be the same as if we should
declare that we were in the councils of God before the
foundations of the world were laid, and could point out
with our finger the elect and the non-elect. Without
this latter covenant, which is more properly understood to
be established between God and men, that first conditional
covenant would be in vain to all men through human de-
pravity, and the precious and infinitely meritorious blood
of Christ would flow in vain. But since, as it was said,
God alone knows them to whom this covenant has regard,
it is our business to urge and press that first conditional
covenant, which is revealed to us; and this is that which
we contend was confirmed by the death of Christ with the
whole human race. Lastly, it is to be observed‚ although
that conditional covenant is not actually made known to
all men, yet it is of such a kind, that it may be divulged
