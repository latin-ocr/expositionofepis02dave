whatever, and moreover should promise, that any one who
should use it should undoubtedly recoverhis former health‚
any one would rightly conclude from thence, that this herb
was a remedy for any disease, applicable‚ by the ordination
of God, to all sick persons individually3 but would not
rightly infer that every individual would be infallibly
cured by means of this remedy, because it would not be
given to some that they should find this remedy, and others
perhaps would not be willing to make use of it when it was
found : So, because God sent the Redeemer into the

offered up for the sins of all men, that all together, with-
out exception, might, through his death, by believing‚ ob-
tain remissiori of sins and salvation. Nor is it contrary to
the Divine wisdom to appoint and sometimes to confer
upon men means ordained and applicable to a certain end,
and at the same time to permit many men to fail of attain-
