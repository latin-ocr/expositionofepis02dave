of it, because they chose to repel it, But he teaches that
a good will was given to some, and that it could not but
be repelled by all to whom it is not given. We produced
some of his testimonies before, we will now subjoin some
others. (Lib. l, de ver. Praedest. p. 158,) Not indeed he-
caase we will, do we receive grace, bnt neither is grace given
to as whilsc we are willing. A little after, p. 159, Grace
alone prodaces a good will in ns, ic alone gives saith to the
will. The will, which has notfaith, cannot have any merit of
saith to be received, because not to havejaith is to dispsease God.
Again, (lib. 2, not far from the beginning, p. 160) It is the
part of God to give his grace lo what ‘men he will, and as mach
as he will. He does not give it as dne z'o the wills or worlcs 0]
men, bnt being metcg'fnl and kind, he gratnitonsiy ponrs it into
the hearts of those whom he has enlightened. And therefore he
freely granis it to whom he will, and as mach as he will, be-
cause he is not inviled by any beginning qs good will, nor by
the effect (ff any good worlc, bey‘ore he bestows grace. These
things are a death-blow to Pelagian and also to Arminiau
sentiments, which state that quickening and saving grace
(of which Fulgentius speaks) are prepared or given to no
one according to the purpose of the electiori of God, but
are contingently given or denied to some according· to the
different condition of the human will obeying or opposing
it: which theology displeased even the sounder Papists.
A few testimonies of whom we shall add by way of over-
weight. ,
Dominious Bannes (in l, Aquin. qu. 32, conclus. ult. p.
278) says, God determinedfrom εἰει-11119, by a will either ab
solute or consequent, not to give to all men supernataral assis-
tance. Bne 1] any one should inquire why he rather confers
these gists on some persons in particular, but denies them to
others, this depends on the simple will of God, neither is any
reason (ff ic to be sought, as Angustine and Thomas {each us.
A little after, Therefore let the Christian and humhle divine
Iearn wilh Thomas and Augustine to be ignorant, ralher than
