Ver-4· EPISTLE To THE COLOSSlANS. 25

The revealing, or manifestation, or appearing of Christ, is
propounded in a threefold manner in the Scriptures:

First. he is manifested bodily in the flesh, to the bodily
eyes of men, in his nativity. Whence Simeon, Lnke ii.
30, congratulates himself on the bodily sight of Christ:
Now lectest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have
seen thy salvation. God was manifest in the flesh, lTim.
iii. 16.

Secondly, he is manifested spiritually in the preaching
of the Gospel, to the spiritual eyes of believers. Of this
manifestation Paul speaks in Gal. iii. l, Who hath hewitched
you that με should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus
Christ was evzdently setjo7·th. And in John, 1 Epist. i. 2,

Thirdly‚ he 1emains to be manifested to the whole world ·
in the splendour of his glory, by his comino to judge the.
living and the dead. Of this final manifestation the Apos-
tle is speaking: for unto this day the glorification of his
saints is deferred, doubtless to be perfected then. I [σηοω
{hat my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter
day upon the earth, Job xix. 25. And l Cor. xv. 52, 53,
The trumpet shall smmd, and the (lead shall be raised incorrup-
tible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must pat

that festal day of which the Apostle subjoins a clear and
most delightful promise in these words following,

3. Then shall pse also appear wilh him in glory, or glo-
rious] That is, Then shall ye each be made like to your
glorious Head and Saviour Jesus Christ. The promised
glory of this eternal life <if I may speak with the School-
men) consists in a twofold array3 in the robe of the soul,
and the robe of the body. The robe of the soul consists,
First‚ in the manifest vision of God, which succeeds to
faith3 according to that declaration of the Apostle‚ Now
we see through a gloss durh-lm but then face to face, l Cor.
xiii. 12. Seconffly, in that perfect fruition, which suc-
