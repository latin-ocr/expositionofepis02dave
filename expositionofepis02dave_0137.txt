Ver. 15. Epls’rLE 'ro THE coLosslANs. 127

Now, from what hath been said concerning the origin of
peace, its office, and the incentives to it, these instructions
arise :

From the Author God, tlze peace (ff God.

l. That the peace of God rules among all those in whom
the God of peace dwells : and on the other hand, they who
reject this peace of God, thrust out the God of peace him-
self. Thus speaks the Apostle‚ 2 Cor. xiii. ll. Live in
peace, and the God of love aad peace shall be with-you.

2. Whatever of religion and holiness, therefore, schis-
matics pretend to, they promote the cause of the devil‚
not of God. For he is the author and the sower of dis-
cord: But the true God, is tlze Godof peace, 1 Cor. xiv. 33.

3. Α union‚ or rather a confederacy, to assail the godly,
extinguish the Gospel, and disseminate errors, is not a “
3 mark of the Church: because there is not among them
the peace of God, but the peace of the devil3 such sub-
sisted between Herod and Pilate; such is preserved among
the very devils. In vain do the Romanists, therefore, boast
of this union as among the marks of their Church, These
instructions are derived from the origin of peace.

From the office ; rale in your hear-ts.

1. This peaceable disposition ought to prevail in all
others, and to exercise as it were a regal power over them.

1. They who are opposed to this, are to be seized‚ re-
strained, and as it were put in chains, as rebels against
their king. Of this kind are wrath, envy, hatred, and the
other pests of human happiness and tranquillity.

3. Let counterfeit benevolence, pretended love, hypo-
critical reconciliation, be far from a Christian man3 for
charity and peace ought to hold the sway in his heart, not
to play merely in his countenance or his words.

From the incentives3 to the which also με are called in one
body.

1. They who disturb the peace of the Church are un·
mindful of their vocation, and despisers of the Divine ap-
pointment. For they whom God hath called and gathered
together into his Church, the same lie commands to dwell
together, as it were in unanimous brotherhood, in their
paternal house.
