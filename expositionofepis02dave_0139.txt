Ver. 15. EPISTLE 'ro THE conossrANs. 129

mortals and outcasts called and chosen into the Church
(which is the house of God), render themselves grateful to
God their Lord, by living in the same peacefully ; but ap-
pear as ungrateful by separating and rending it in pieces
with dissentions. On this account therefore, the Apostle
subjoined, And be με thankfiael, namely, towards God, by
whom ye are called into one body.

But gratitude towards men is also required, that peace
may be kept inviolate: because troubles and enmities
sometimes arise, as well from kindnesses not duly repaid,
as from injuries inflicted. Which we perceive in the ex-
ample of Nabal, l Saml. xxv.; who by his ingratitude so
exasperated the mind of David, that unless the prudence
and humanity of Abigail had relieved him, that ungrateful
man and his whole family would have been ruined. The ·
Apostle truly thinks this the worst and most pernicious
vice, which he numbers with the worst and most pernicious
vices in 2 Tim. iii. 2. ¹

Instructions;

1. If we would have God to remain kind to us, we
ought to shew ourselves thankful to him, and grateful for
the benefits conferred upon us.

2. The best proof that we can give of our gratitude is
that we obey the Divine will. The chief (ff gratanda says

Clemens, isto do what is agreeable to the pleasure of God.
Strom. 7.

3. Those benefitted by kindnesses, are bound by the
Divine command (if occasion offers) to return thanks to
their benefactors not in mere words, but in reality. We
have the example of Joshua towards the harlot Rahab,
Josh. vi. 233 of David towards the sons of Barzillai, l
Kings ii. 7, διε. Therefore they are to be blamed, and
scarcely to be looked upon as men, who not only neglect
returning kindnesses to their friends from whom they have
received benefits3 but, lest they should seem to acknow-
ledge that they owe any gratitude‚ load them oft-times
with injuries and reproaches. Such were the men of Kei-
lah towards David, 1 Sami. xxiii. 12. Such also was the
conduct of Hanun, 2 Sam. x. 4. Such that of the Jews
