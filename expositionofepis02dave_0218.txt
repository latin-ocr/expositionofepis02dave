duties are performed to men according to the direction and
at the command of Christ, and on account of the appoint-
ment and for the glory of Christ, they arejudged to be of-
fered and rendered to Christ himself. For he serves God,
whofor the salse of God serves men, as Jerome has rightly
observed on this passage. This Christ himself shews‚
Matt. xxv. 40, 45, Inasmuclz as ye have done it unco one (f
the least (ysthescz με have done it wito me ,·, ΙηαεηῖηεΙι as με did
ic not to one of tlte least (gf these, pse did it not to me. He
speaks in this place concerning alms-deeds, as far as they
are done or denied to men; but it ought to be extended to
all the works of obedience commanded by God: for when
these are rendered to men, they are rendered to God who
commanded thern to be done3 when denied to them, they
are deerned as denied to God himself. And that rightly
too : for he who, being commanded by God to obey men, re-
fuses to yield to human authority3 if he had power would
also shake off the Divine government.

]. No service is dishonourable in which men conduct
themselves well and faithfully: for they who are such, serve
Christ himself, which is the height of dignity and honour.

2. No honour, no authority screens a wicked man from
ignominy and disgrace ε for they who are of that character
serve the deril, which is the abyss of infamy and misery.

3. They who, being placed under the rule of others, are
unwilling to serve, are not only rebels against men, but
against God and Christ. Hence that reproof of God him-
self against the Israelites wishing to shake off the govern-
ment of Samuel, They have not rejected thee, buc they have
rejected me, 1 Sam. viii. 7.

4. We ought not to obey any mortal among those who
are opposed to the will of Christ: For it is unjust and fo-
reign to reason that those should be obeyed against. the
will of Christ, whom we obey for Christ.

And thus much of the former incentive, derived from the
promise of a reward: It remains to treat of the other, taken
from the threat of punishment.
