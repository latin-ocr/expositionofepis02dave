444 Α DlSSERTATlON ΟΝ THE DEATH OF CHRIST-

ΟΒ] ECTIO Ν. Here some Divines object to υς, Then, ac-
cording to our opinion, God will not be reconciled and pa-
cified to any sinner through and on account of the death of
Christ, but only reconcileable and placable: man also by
the death of Christ is not reconciled to God, but is recon-
cileable under some certain condition, namely, of saith.

I answer3 that the consequence is faulty. God is re-
coucileable by the deatlz (ff Christ lo am] man wlzo is about
zo believe.- leerefore he is not reconciled through Clu-ist to
every one tlzat believetlz, buc only is reconcileable. Truly, we
profess that God is reconcileable to every man that believ-
eth, through and on account of Christ; and also that he
has given this condition of saith, by means of which ac-
tual reconciliation is acquired through and on account of
Christ. In vain then, and falsely do they argue from the
position of an universal benefit, namely, of reconciliabi-
lity‚ on performing the condition of saith, to the removal
or denying of particular benefits, as of reconciliation and
salvation, since both are derived from the death and merit
of Christ3 although those general benefits are performed
without any act of ours intervening3 those particular ones,
not without any act of ourS‚ although not on account of
any act of ours.

It is objected, secondly, which seems to be of greater
importance, If we say that God is, by the death of
Christ, made so placable and reconcileable to every
man, that he is ready to receive any one into favour,
if he should believe, but is not actually reconciled to any
one before he believes, then we seem to make the virtue of
the death of Christ, as to itself, of little importance to
offer itself to all; and God himself also to be indifferent
towards all, and as it were to wait for the determination of
an inferior cause, that the death of his Son may be benefi-
cial or otherwise3 which is nothing else than with the Se-
mipelagians to suspend the salvation or perdition of indi-
viduals on the free-will of each, according as they, by
saith, apprehend or reject Christ.

I answer, that in order to its being assumed that
God by the death of Christ is so far pacified or placable
