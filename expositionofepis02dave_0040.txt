the utigodly may prevail : but against the good things
promised, and our eternal lise nothing can prevail.

Reproofs.
l. They are to be blamed, w-ho, either never think, or

think not with joy of Christ and the coming of Christ.
For who can excuse their torpor who do not ardently desire
the life of his life, who do not wait for that natal day of
this new life with gladness?

2. And they also are deservedly to be blamed who seek
the glory of this world: for what else is this than to wish
to violate this Divine decree'? He has decreed that the
glory of Christians is to be expected on the second com-
ing of Christ. In the meanwhile, it behoves us to bear the
injuries and miseries of time, to dream not here of glory
and happiness, unless hereafter to hear with Dives, Re-
memher tlzal thou in tlzy lffelime receivedst thy good things, and
mcewise Lazarus evil things, but now he z's comforted and thou
art tormented‚ Luke xvi. 25. .

3. They are to be derided, or rather to be pitied as the
madmen of this world, who think themselves happy be-
cause they enjoy the pleasures, the honours, the wealth of
this world3 and think the pious‚ on the contrary, to be
most abject and miserable, because they, for the most part,
are destitute. But those are not truly happy, for whom
eternal misery remains, nor those miserable, whom eternal
glory awaits. Well said Lactantius. Instit. 6. 22, As we
arv-ive at true good through fallacious evils, so we cometo real
evil through fallacious good. And thus we dismiss the first

member of the general exhortation.
