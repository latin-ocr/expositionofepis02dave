they were born, that acceptance will denote the purpose of
communicating his goodneSS, not the acc of communica·-
tion itself‚ as was mentioned before from Aquinas. Beza ,
also, in,his Commentaries on the 5th verse, has rightly ob-
served‚ That the elect z'n dae time receive wisdom‚ righteons-
ness, sanctification, and redemptionfreely bysaith; therefore
they are not from eternity justified, sanctified, or recon-
ciled. although elected and predestinated from eternity.
But no one hath taught this more plainly than the Apostle
himself, who demonstrates that the same persons whom he
said were chosen before the foundation cf the world. yet were
by nature the children of wrath (Ephes. ii. 3), and long re-
mained without Christ, being oliensfrom the commonwealtlz
of Israel, and strangers from the covenants ofpronzise, having· Ι
no hope, and without God in the world. Bac now, in Christ
Jesus, με who formerly were far off, are made nigh by che blood
(ff Christ, when, through the blood of Christ received⁴by
saith, they were reconciled to God (ver. 12, 13, &c.) If,
therefore, we believe St. Paul, although the election and
predestination of mankind proceeds from the eternal love
of God, yet it is not to be said, that their eternal justifica-
tion and reconciliation are manifested and revealed when
they believe in Christ, but that they then first take place.

Again3 The Apostle says (2 Tim. i. 9, 10), Thatgrace was
given to the elect in Christ Jesns, before the world began, but
is now made manifest by the appear-ing (f our Saviour Jesus
Clm'st. But God evidently appears to be reconciled to
them, before the world began, to whom he then gave grace
in Christ.

REPLY. On account of the unchangeableness and im-
moveableness of the Divine purpose, that grace is said to
be given to the elect before the world began, which was
then destined for them. In t'his passage, therefore, eternal
giving is eternal preparation of grace infallibly to be given
to the elect in due time. Thus Augustine observes, The
A postle says that grace was given when there were not as yet
persons to whom it should be given, because in che disposition
andpredestination of God, that was now done which was to be
done in his own time. (De doctr. Christ. lib. 3, cap. 34.)
