some past offence. It is briefly defined by Damascenus,
lib. 2, cap. 16, ὄρεξις vn} ἀντιτιμωρησεως. tlze appetite for re-
venge. And in this unjust and vindictive desire of revenge
(as the Schoolmen say) tlieformal of anger is contained.
Θυμὸς, or wratlz, denotes the hasty excitement of this pas-
sion, and that accession of blood around the heart, which
the Schoolmen call the material of anger. Whence the
same Damascenus sayS, in the passage before quoted3
Θυμός εςτι ζεσις *ro* υ περὶ καρδίαν ”αιματος εξάναιὲυμιάσεως ττῗς χολνῖς
γινομένη. Wrallz is tlte hoilz'ng up of tlze blood armmd tlze
heare, which arises from tlze kindling qf resencment. Κακία or
malice, as some will have it, is a general vice, and denotes
that vicious propensity which infects all the affections and
desires, and inclines them to evil. Whence Bernard, in
his Serm. l, De pugn. spir. says, malice is the tastefor evil:
it is, then, the property of malice to make evil savoury
and sweet3 and, on the contrary, to render good insipid
and unpleasant. But in this place I consider κακία to de-
note especially that machination of evil in the heart, which
is wont to arise from anger in malevolent and incensed
minds. We see all these in the example of Cain, Gen. iv.
5, Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell: thence
he contrives the murder of Abel, when he says, Let us go
out.- This was the effect of his malice. From the same
disease of malice proceeded those words of Esau, Gen.
xxvii. 41, T lte days of mourm'ng for my father are at hand,
then will I εἶαρ my brother Jacob.

You will now see what and what kind of sins are here
reproved by the Apostle. It follows that we should, in the
second place, offer some reasons for which these sins of
an angry mind are to be opposed and extirpated. Gregory,
in Moral. 5, cap. 31, adduces many:

l. Because through anger the use of wisdom is lost,
yea, reason itself is for the time extinguished. Hence, on
that passage in Eccles. vii. 9, Anger rests in tlze bosom (ff α
fool, Basil, in his Homily against anger, sayS, Anger ren-
ders α man altogether ferocious, nor szgffers him to remain any
more α man. The sentiment of the Poet‚ Anger is a short
ηιαᾶηεεε, is well known.
