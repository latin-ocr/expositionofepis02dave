Ver.23. EPISTLE To THE conossrANS. 201

effect, he places the sear of God with singleness of heart:
and rightly indeed3 For he who fears or respects men
alone, will be changeable and inconst-ant in discharging
any office, because he is directed by an uncertain rule: for
indeed the fear of man is inconstant, inasmuch as it is in-
cited whilst he is present, it vanishes on his being absent:
but the fear of God is constant and firm in the bosoms of

the pious, because God is always present to them, and
never ought or can be imagined as absent. I am α God at
hand, and not α God afar off, Jer. xxiii. 23. This was not
unknown to the poet, who said, God seetlz thee being near
at hand. We have a remarkable example of the sear of
God in Joseph: who, when 116 was solicited to commit
adultery by his mistress herself whilst his master was ab·
sent and unoonscious, would not hearken to her; but re-
pelled her shamelessness by these words, How ccm I do
this wickedness, and sin against God? If he had been-only
a man-pleaser, he both could and without doubt would
have done it: but because he feared God the Supreme
Lord‚ he could not wrong his earthly lord by this injury.
Such are all they who obey their masters with singleness ‘ff
beart, feuring God.

Vers. 23. And whacsoever *ise dv, do it ἢεανίίῖῃ, as to the
Lord‚ and noc utzto men.

The Apostle proceeds still in describing the manner of
lawful obedience: and he adds another condition, namely,
that all the duties of servants should be performed, not
only in singleness effheart and tlzesear (ff God, but alsofrom
tlte beart: and he immediately subjoins the reason3 namely,
because they serve the Lord‚ i. e. Christ, not men. Let us
therefore consider, first, the condition requisite in all the

obedience of servants3 secondly, the reason of the condi-
tion required.
