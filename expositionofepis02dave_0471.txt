because he would not that the satisfaction made by him for
the sins of the human race, should avail to the actual re-
conciliation of individuals, without the. intervention of
their saith, as it was proved before. It would therefore be
reproachful to Christ, if any one should be admitted into
the fellowship and actual participation of this grace, who
does not believe in Jesus Christ the Author of salvation,
and our Redeemer. Nor is injustice done to men, that they

Son shall not see life, but tlze wraclz ⁰f God abidetlz on him.

men under the guilt of sin, and subjects them to Divine
wrath: Therefore, the act of Christ dying ought to deliver
all men from death, to reconcile them to God, and to place
them in a state of grace and salvation.

REPLY. In this argument is involved a false supposi-
tion. In the major proposition it is as it were taken for
granted, that the efficacy or virtue of any cause is always
to be estimated greater or less according as it extends
itself to more or fewer subjects3 which is very false. For
the efficacy or excellence of a cause is to be estimated from
the nature and excellency of its effects rather than from
