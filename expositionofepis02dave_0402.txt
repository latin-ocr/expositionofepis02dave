even the illustration of his glory, by the demonstration of
his justice towards those who abuse the means ordained to

will follow, First, That Christ had loved all men with the
highest and greatest love. John xv. 13, Greater love hath
no man than this, tlzat α man lag] down his li efor lzisjriends,
And l John iii. 16, Herebzs per-ceive we the love <ff God, be-
