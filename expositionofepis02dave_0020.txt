10 AN EXPOSITION or ετ. PAUL’s Chapdii,

Ifye be risen with Chrisl] That it is our duty to seek
and affect the things which are above he argues, first from
our resurrection with Christ: For ‘these words ifye be
risen, are not expressive of doubt, but the language of in-
ference and conclusion: for the assumption, viz. με are
risen wilh Christ, is presupposed from those things which
were contended for in the foregoing Chapter, verses 12 and
13. And this argument proceeds from the cause to the
effect: for this our resurrection which we have by Christ,
is the efficient principle of the new life, and, therefore, of
the new conversation and work. For we must know, that
Christ, by the same power wherewith he raised himself from
corporea} death, bath raised all his people from spiritual
-a death. Hence said Bernard, There is a twcffold resurrection:
one of the soul, which the secret coming of Christ cfficts ; the
other <ff the body, which the glorious coming of Christ will ac-
complish. And as the outwarcl man will receive in its corporeal
resurrection, rtew life andfzmctions: so in this} spiritual resur-
rection, the iuner man now receives new life and α new sensitive
power. Hence that injunction of the Apostle, Rom. vi. 4,
As Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the

β. Ὲαΐῖιεν, so we also should walle in newness cf lg’ft. This spi-

ritual resurrection is effected in baptism, both sacramen-
tally and really3 sacramentally, by the external adminis—
tration of the rite3 really, by the internal operation of the
Holy Spirit. The Apostle comprehends both in Tit. iii. 5,
According to his mercy he saved us hy the ‘evashz'ng of regenera-
tion and renewing of the Holy Ghost. These things being
laid down, it is clear, that this ought to be the greatest
inducement to all believers to seek and savour the things
which are above. For he who is risen again is risen to
another kind of life3 but he who is risen with Christ, he,
as far as it can be done in this life, ought to imitate Christ
rising again. Therefore, like as Christ, being raised from
the dead, cared no more for earthly things, but ascended
to heaven to live a glorious and heavenly life: so Chris-
tians, who are spiritually raised, ought not to cleave to
earthly things and desires, but elevate their minds to
heaven.
