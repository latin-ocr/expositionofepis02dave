354 Α ῐηςεΕΗΊἈΤῐοΝ ON THE DEATH OF cuaisr,

whom we. may add the African FatherS, in their Synodical
Epistle, and the Council of' Valence, in the 5th Canon.
By this first argument therefore we prove. that the meri-
torious efficacy of the death of Christ is not to be re-
stricted to the elect alone, but is applicable to others
from the ordination of God, and is actually applied as to
certain effects.

2. He who by undergoing death by the ordination of
God sustained the punishment due not only to the sins of
certain individual persons, but of the whole human race 3
His passion, by virtue of the same ordination, is appli-
cable not only to certain definite persons, but to every in-
dividual of the human race. But Christ by dying sus-
tained the punishment due to the sins of the world :
Therefore, he willed that his death should be, as it were,
an universal cause of salvation applicable to all. He who
denies the major. is bound to shew why God willed that
his Son should bear the sins of the human race, if he was
unwilling to appoint in his death a cause at least appli-
cable to the human race, although the application would
not follow in many. We cannot conceive any other causes
of this, than that it should please the Divine goodness and
wisdom to exact from our Redeemer, and as it were to re·
ceive into his own hands, an universal ransom applicable
to all. lst. That in its application the liberty of the Di-
vine will, doing what he will with his own, and his special
kindness towards the elect, might more. eminently appear.
2dly. That he might afford a specimen of great mercy to-
wards the non-elect, at least towards those who are called
into the church. 3dly. That unbelievers might be con-
vinced in their own consciences, that a mode of liberating
them was not wanting on the part of Christ, but that they
were wanting to themselves, according to the saying of
Christ, John v. 40, Ye will not come unto me tlzczt “le might
lzave lg'fe. Now let us descend to the minor, in which it is
affirmed, that Christ sustained the punishment due to the
sins of the human race. Thus the Scriptures speak, All
we like sheep lzczve gone aslray, we have turned every] one to leis
own way, (md tlte Lord laath laid οη Hz’m tlte iniquz'ry of us
