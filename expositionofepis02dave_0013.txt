EXPOSITION

THE THIRD CHAPTER,

WE have now finished the two former Chapters of this ‘
Epistle3 and shall proceed, with the Divine assistance, to
the explication of the third Chapter. But, in the first
place, we must premise, what the scope of the Apostle is3
for it is useful, nay, necessary to have this before our eyes,
that we may understand what an apt and suitable bearing
all his observations have upon it. The whole discussion,
then, of the Apostle has respect to this, viz. that after the·r
doctrine of the faith of the Gospel had been established,
4 and the impostures of false apostles exploded‚ he might

” stir up the Colossians to exercise holiness of life, and

avoid corrupt morals. For it is customary with St. Paul,
in all his Epistles, to subjoin to disputations concerning
the saith, exhortation} to newness of life: For he would
have a good tree to bear good fruit, namely‚ a sound faith
to yield a holy life. You perceive the scope. In the se-
cond place, then, it is easy to elicit the sum or argument
of the whole Chapter, and, as it were, to include it in a

few lines. This, then, is what is here inculcated by the

ζ ζ Apossse, viz. that the Colossians, and so all true Chris-

tians, are made partakers of the death and resurrection of

Christ; and on this account it behoves them to die to sin,

to live to God, to put off the old man with his deeds, and

to put on the new man. The sum, then, of the Apostolic

exhortation is contained in these two propositions : 1, Α
vor„ 11. Β
