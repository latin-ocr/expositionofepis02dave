Ver. 19. ΕΡιεΤιΕ To THE conossmns. 161

thou, my son, be ravished witlz a strange woman and embracc
tlze bosomcf α stranger? Yea, Aristotle himself considers
it injustice in the husband, if he despise his wife, and in-
dulge unlawful pleasures elsewhere: and he calls that undi-
vided so‘ciety of life, and due benevolence which the hus-
band is bound to yield towards his wife, α pious and mast
lzoly dwellz'ug together, and dignffied station of marriage, The
opinion, therefore, or rather impiety, of the Emperor
AElius Verus, is to be rejected3 who is wrong in having
affirmed‚ that the wife was a title (ff dignity, not ofplea-
sure: as though wives should be satisfied that husbands
condescended to honour them by contracting marriage with
the1n3 and in the mean time it might be allowed the hus-
band to follow pleasures, or rather iniquity‚ out of matri-

that by a prudent husband nothing should be neglected of
those things which tend to tlze instruction <ff his wife: and he
alleges the cause3 namely, that she herself by being well
informed may be capable of instructing her children. This
also in Xenophon, in his Oeconomics, Ischomachus, whom
that sweet writer proposed as an example of a good hus-
band, as Cyrus, of a good king, says that he carefully did.
Therefore he himself says, that he taught his wife, what
might suffice for those cares which related to her office·⁷
and for this end, first songht from God, both that he 111111-
self might teach those things which would be best for
either, and especially that she might learn the same. This

duty of love (as you may perceive) was not concealed even
from the heathen themselves, particularly as far as it re-
lates to this life. But the sacred writers also extend this

care of thc husband to the otim· life: for he ouyht even
