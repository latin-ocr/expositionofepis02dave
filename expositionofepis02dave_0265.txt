Ver. 5. EPISTLE το THE cotossrANs. 255

God's. Paul preached this, Rom. xiii. 1, Let every soal be
subject anto the higher powers. Peter himself advised to this,
l Epis. ii. 153, Submit your-selves to every ordinance of man
for the Lord' s salce;wl1etlzer zt be to the lsing, as supreme, or
wito governors as sent by him, &c. But all these concern-
ing whom Christ, Paul, and Peter spake‚ were in that age
heathens and idolaters. It is, therefore, the duty of a
Christian walking wisely, even to honour heathens and
unbelievers invested with power, to pay them tribute, to
yield them obedience, and to do all those other things to
which they are bound by laws not opposing the Divine
laws. So Augustine, Quaest. V. et N. Test. quaest. 35,
says, The king is always to he honoured, ffnot for his own
sake, yet on account of his station ,· and De civit. Dei, lib. 5,
cap. 19, T lte power of rulz'ng is not given to the wiclcecl, unless ’
by the Providence of tlte Most Higlz God, when hejudges ltu·
man affairs wortliy of such masters,· and cap. 21, He 13>le
gave the kingdom to a Christian Constantine, lte also gave it to
an apostate Julian. If even he gave the kingdom to an uns
believer, men may not withhold their obedience on ac·
count of infidelity.

2. Now, in the second place, we must speak more dis-
tinctly concerning the persons towards whom it behoves
us to exercise this wisdom. And they are called them that
are without. Under which title he denotes all not as yet
admitted into the Church3 as also in l Cor. v, 12, What
have Ι to do to judge tlzem that are without? For the
Church is as a certain spiritual house: hence they who
have enlisted their names under Christ, are accounted the
servants offaith: they who have not done so, arejudged
to be stt-angers and foreigners from this family of the faith-
fulft Wisdom is indeed to be exhibited in our walk to-
wards our brethren‚ and in like manner towards all men 3
but special mention is made of them that are without in
this place, because there is special difficulty in that re-
spect. And the Apostle designated (as it is said) heathens
and pagens by this word, on account of the circumstances
